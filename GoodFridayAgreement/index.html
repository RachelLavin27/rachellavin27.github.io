							Have you read the Good Friday Agreement?
							<br><br>
								This 35 page document has achieved 23 years of peace, bringing an end to the 30 year conflict that was the Troubles in Northern Ireland
								and allowing a generation to grow up in peace.
								<br><br>
								However, those 'peace babies' come of age in a time when the Good Friday Agreement is under strain.
								<br><br>
								While the international peace agreement became a critical component in EU and Brexit negotiations, many people, including the UK's foreign secretary Dominic Raab admitted to not having read it in full.
								<br><br>
								And at the same time support for a border poll grows in the South, one in four young people from the Republic, when polled, said they <a class="link" href="https://www.businesspost.ie/politics/new-poll-one-in-four-young-people-dont-know-if-they-support-the-gfa-f40c16f5">'didn't know'</a> if they support it.
									<br><br>
									Here, activist Emma DeSousa, Oxford academic Jennifer Cassidy and journalist Susan McKay talk you through the key components of the historic text that shapes the past, present and future of Ireland and the UK.

							<p> <div class="texttitle">The Belfast Agreement:
	<br><br>
								The Agreement reached at the Multi-Party talks on Northern Ireland.</div>
								<br><br>
							<br><br>Annex: Agreement between the Government of the United
							Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the
							Government of Ireland.<br>
							<br><b>DECLARATION OF SUPPORT</b>
							<br>1. <mark> We, the participants in the multi-party negotiations, believe that the
							agreement we have negotiated offers a truly historic opportunity for a new
							beginning</mark>.

							<br><br>2. The tragedies of the past have left a deep and profoundly regrettable
							legacy of suffering. We must never forget those who have died or been
							injured, and their families. But we can best honour them through a fresh
							start, in which we firmly dedicate ourselves to the achievement of
							reconciliation, tolerance, and mutual trust, and to the protection and
							vindication of the human rights of all.
							<br><br>3. We are committed to partnership, equality and mutual respect as the
							basis of relationships within Northern Ireland, between North and South,
							and between these islands.

							<br><br>4. We reaffirm our total and absolute commitment to exclusively
							democratic and peaceful means of resolving differences on political
							issues, and our opposition to any use or threat of force by others for any
							political purpose, whether in regard to this agreement or otherwise.
							<br><br>5. We acknowledge the substantial differences between our continuing,
							and equally legitimate, political aspirations. However, we will endeavour
							to strive in every practical way towards reconciliation and rapprochement
							within the framework of democratic and agreed arrangements. We pledge
							that we will, in good faith, work to ensure the success of each and every
							one of the arrangements to be established under this agreement. It is
							accepted that all of the institutional and constitutional arrangements - an
							Assembly in Northern Ireland, a North/South Ministerial Council,
							implementation bodies, a British-Irish Council and a British-Irish
							Intergovernmental Conference and any amendments to British Acts of
							Parliament and the Constitution of Ireland - are interlocking and
							interdependent and that in particular the functioning of the Assembly and
							the North/South Council are so closely inter-related that the success of
							each depends on that of the other.
							<br><br>6. Accordingly, in a spirit of concord, we strongly commend this
							agreement to the people, North and South, for their approval.


							<br><br><br>Constitutional Issues:
							<br><br>1. The participants endorse the commitment made by the British and Irish
							Governments that, in a new British-Irish Agreement replacing the AngloIrish Agreement, they will:
							<br><br>      (i) recognise the legitimacy of whatever choice is freely exercised by a
							majority of the people of Northern Ireland with regard to its status,
							whether they prefer to continue to support the Union with Great Britain or
							a sovereign united Ireland;
							<br><br>      (ii) recognise that it is for the people of the island of Ireland alone, by
							agreement between the two parts respectively and without external
							impediment, to exercise their right of self-determination on the basis of
							consent, freely and concurrently given, North and South, to bring about a
							united Ireland, if that is their wish, accepting that this right must be
							achieved and exercised with and subject to the agreement and consent of a
							majority of the people of Northern Ireland;
							<br><br>      (iii) acknowledge that while a substantial section of the people in
							Northern Ireland share the legitimate wish of a majority of the people of
							the island of Ireland for a united Ireland, the present wish of a majority of
							the people of Northern Ireland, freely exercised and legitimate, is to
							maintain the Union and, accordingly, that Northern Ireland’s status as part
							of the United Kingdom reflects and relies upon that wish; and that it
							would be wrong to make any change in the status of Northern Ireland save
							with the consent of a majority of its people;
								<br><br>    (iv) affirm that if, in the future, the people of the island of Ireland exercise
							their right of self-determination on the basis set out in sections (i) and (ii)
							above to bring about a united Ireland, it will be a binding obligation on
							both Governments to introduce and support in their respective Parliaments
							legislation to give effect to that wish;

								people of Northern Ireland, the power of the sovereign government with
								jurisdiction there shall be exercised with <mark> rigorous impartiality on behalf of
								all the people in the diversity of their identities and traditions and shall be
								founded on the principles of full respect for, and equality of, civil,
								political, social and cultural rights, of freedom from discrimination for all

							British and Irish citizenship is accepted by both Governments and would
							not be affected by any future change in the status of Northern Ireland.</mark>
								<br><br>2. The participants also note that the two Governments have accordingly
							undertaken in the context of this comprehensive political agreement, to
							propose and support changes in, respectively, the Constitution of Ireland
							and in British legislation relating to the constitutional status of Northern
							Ireland.</div>

							<p><br><br>Annex A
							DRAFT CLAUSES/SCHEDULES FOR INCORPORATION IN
							BRITISH LEGISLATION
							<br><br>1. (1) It is hereby declared that Northern Ireland in its entirety remains
							part of the United Kingdom and shall not cease to be so without the
							consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland voting in a poll
							held for the purposes of this section in accordance with Schedule 1.
								<br><br>(2) But <mark>if the wish expressed by a majority in such a poll is that Northern
							Ireland should cease to be part of the United Kingdom and form part of a
							united Ireland</mark>, the Secretary of State shall lay before Parliament such
							proposals to give effect to that wish as may be agreed between Her
							Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of
							Ireland.
							<br><br>	2. The Government of Ireland Act 1920 is repealed; and this Act shall
							have effect notwithstanding any other previous enactment.
							<br><br>SCHEDULE 1
							POLLS FOR THE PURPOSE OF SECTION 1	<br><br>
								<br><br>1. The Secretary of State may by order direct the holding of a poll for the
							purposes of section 1 on a date specified in the order.
								<br><br>2. Subject to paragraph 3, <mark>the Secretary of State shall exercise the power
							under paragraph 1 if at any time it appears likely to him that a majority of
							those voting would express a wish that Northern Ireland should cease to
							be part of the United Kingdom and form part of a united Ireland.</mark>
								<br><br>3. The Secretary of State shall not make an order under paragraph 1
							earlier than seven years after the holding of a previous poll under this
							Schedule.
								<br><br>4. (Remaining paragraphs along the lines of paragraphs 2 and 3 of existing
							Schedule 1 to 1973 Act.)
							<br><br>Annex B
							IRISH GOVERNMENT DRAFT LEGISLATION TO AMEND THE
							CONSTITUTION
							<br><br>Add to Article 29 the following sections:
							7.
							1. The State may consent to be bound by the British-Irish Agreement done
							at Belfast on the day of 1998, hereinafter called the Agreement.
							<br><br>1. Any institution established by or under the Agreement may exercise the
							powers and functions thereby conferred on it in respect of all or any part
							of the island of Ireland notwithstanding any other provision of this
							Constitution conferring a like power or function on any person or any
							organ of State appointed under or created or established by or under this
							Constitution. Any power or function conferred on such an institution in
							relation to the settlement or resolution of disputes or controversies may be
							in addition to or in substitution for any like power or function conferred
							by this Constitution on any such person or organ of State as aforesaid.
						<br><br>	1. If the Government declare that the State has become obliged, pursuant
							to the Agreement, to give effect to the amendment of this Constitution
							referred to therein, then, notwithstanding Article 46 hereof, this
							Constitution shall be amended as follows:
						<br><br>	i. the following Articles shall be substituted for Articles 2 and 3 of
							the Irish text:
							"2. [Irish text to be inserted here]
							3. [Irish text to be inserted here]"
							ii. the following Articles shall be substituted for Articles 2 and 3 of the
							English text:</p>

							<p>
							It is the entitlement and birthright of every person born in the island of
							Ireland, which includes its islands and seas, to be part of the Irish nation.
							That is also the entitlement of all persons otherwise qualified in
							accordance with law to be citizens of Ireland. Furthermore, the Irish
							nation cherishes its special affinity with people of Irish ancestry living
							abroad who share its cultural identity and heritage.


								<br><br>Article 3
							1. It is the <mark>firm will of the Irish nation, in harmony and friendship, to unite
							all the people who share the territory of the island of Ireland, in all the
							diversity of their identities and traditions, recognising that a united Ireland
							shall be brought about only by peaceful means with the consent of a
							majority of the people, democratically expressed, in both jurisdictions in
							the island.</mark> Until then, the laws enacted by the Parliament established by
							this Constitution shall have the like area and extent of application as the
							laws enacted by the Parliament that existed immediately before the
							coming into operation of this Constitution.
								<br><br>2. Institutions with executive powers and functions that are shared
							between those jurisdictions may be established by their respective
							responsible authorities for stated purposes and may exercise powers and
							functions in respect of all or any part of the island."
							iii. the following section shall be added to the Irish text of this Article:
							"8. [Irish text to be inserted here]"
							and
								<br><br>iv. the following section shall be added to the English text of this Article:
							"8. The State may exercise extra-territorial jurisdiction in accordance with
							the generally recognised principles of international law."
							<br><br>	4. If a declaration under this section is made, this subsection and
							subsection 3, other than the amendment of this Constitution effected
							thereby, and subsection 5 of this section shall be omitted from every
							official text of this Constitution published thereafter, but notwithstanding
							such omission this section shall continue to have the force of law.
							<br><br>	5. If such a declaration is not made within twelve months of this section
							being added to this Constitution or such longer period as may be provided
							for by law, this section shall cease to have effect and shall be omitted
							from every official text of this Constitution published thereafter.</p>

							<p>STRAND ONE
							DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS IN NORTHERN IRELAND
							<br><br>	1. <mark>This agreement provides for a democratically elected Assembly in
							Northern Ireland which is inclusive in its membership, capable of
							exercising executive and legislative authority, and subject to safeguards to
							protect the rights and interests of all sides of the community.</mark>
								<br><br>The Assembly
								<br><br>2. A 108-member Assembly will be elected by PR(STV) from existing
							Westminster constituencies.
								<br><br>3. The Assembly will exercise full legislative and executive authority in
							respect of those matters currently within the responsibility of the six
							Northern Ireland Government Departments, with the possibility of taking
							on responsibility for other matters as detailed elsewhere in this agreement.
								<br><br>4. The Assembly - operating where appropriate on a cross-community
							basis - will be the prime source of authority in respect of all devolved
							responsibilities.
							Safeguards
								<br><br>5. There will be safeguards to ensure that all sections of the community
							can participate and work together successfully in the operation of these
							institutions and that all sections of the community are protected,
							including:
								<br><br>(a) allocations of Committee Chairs, Ministers and Committee
							membership in proportion to party strengths;
							<br><br>	(b) the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and any Bill of
							Rights for Northern Ireland supplementing it, which neither the Assembly
							nor public bodies can infringe, together with a Human Rights
							Commission;
							<br><br>	(c) arrangements to provide that key decisions and legislation are proofed
							to ensure that they do not infringe the ECHR and any Bill of Rights for
							Northern Ireland;
								<br><br>(d) arrangements to ensure key decisions are taken on a cross-community
							basis;
								<br><br>(i) either parallel consent, i.e. a majority of those members present and
							voting, including a majority of the unionist and nationalist designations
							present and voting;
							<br><br>	(ii) or a weighted majority (60%) of members present and voting,
							including at least 40% of each of the nationalist and unionist designations
							present and voting.
							Key decisions requiring cross-community support will be designated in
							advance, including election of the Chair of the Assembly, the First
							Minister and Deputy First Minister, standing orders and budget
							allocations. In other cases such decisions could be triggered by a petition
							of concern brought by a significant minority of Assembly members
							(30/108).
								<br><br>(e) an Equality Commission to monitor a statutory obligation to promote
							equality of opportunity in specified areas and parity of esteem between the
							two main communities, and to investigate individual complaints against
							public bodies.
							Operation of the Assembly
								<br><br>6. At their first meeting, members of the Assembly will register a
							designation of identity - nationalist, unionist or other - for the purposes of
							measuring cross-community support in Assembly votes under the relevant
							provisions above.
								<br><br>7. The Chair and Deputy Chair of the Assembly will be elected on a crosscommunity basis, as set out in paragraph 5(d) above.
								<br><br>8. There will be a Committee for each of the main executive functions of
							the Northern Ireland Administration. The Chairs and Deputy Chairs of the
							Assembly Committees will be allocated proportionally, using the d’Hondt
							system. Membership of the Committees will be in broad proportion to
							party strengths in the Assembly to ensure that the opportunity of
							Committee places is available to all members.
								<br><br>9. The Committees will have a scrutiny, policy development and
							consultation role with respect to the Department with which each is
							associated, and will have a role in initiation of legislation. They will have
							the power to:
							• consider and advise on Departmental budgets and Annual Plans in the
							context of the overall budget allocation;
							• approve relevant secondary legislation and take the Committee stage of
							relevant primary legislation;
							• call for persons and papers;
							• initiate enquiries and make reports;
							• consider and advise on matters brought to the Committee by its
							Minister.
							<br><br>	10. Standing Committees other than Departmental Committees may be
							established as may be required from time to time.
								<br><br>11. The Assembly may appoint a special Committee to examine and
							report on whether a measure or proposal for legislation is in conformity
							with equality requirements, including the ECHR/Bill of Rights. The
							Committee shall have the power to call people and papers to assist in its
							consideration of the matter. The Assembly shall then consider the report
							of the Committee and can determine the matter in accordance with the
							cross-community consent procedure.
								<br><br>12. The above special procedure shall be followed when requested by the
							Executive Committee, or by the relevant Departmental Committee, voting
							on a cross-community basis.
								<br><br>13. When there is a petition of concern as in 5(d) above, the Assembly
							shall vote to determine whether the measure may proceed without
							reference to this special procedure. If this fails to achieve support on a
							cross-community basis, as in 5(d)(i) above, the special procedure shall be
							followed.
							Executive Authority
								<br><br>14. Executive authority to be discharged on behalf of the Assembly by a
							First Minister
							and Deputy First Minister and up to ten Ministers with Departmental
							responsibilities.
								<br><br>15. The First Minister and Deputy First Minister shall be jointly elected
							into office by the Assembly voting on a cross-community basis, according
							to 5(d)(i) above.
								<br><br>16. Following the election of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister,
							the posts of Ministers will be allocated to parties on the basis of the
							d’Hondt system by reference to the number of seats each party has in the
							Assembly.
								<br><br>17. The Ministers will constitute an Executive Committee, which will be
							convened, and presided over, by the First Minister and Deputy First
							Minister.
								<br><br>18. The duties of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister will include,
							inter alia, dealing with and co-ordinating the work of the Executive
							Committee and the response of the Northern Ireland administration to
							external relationships.
								<br><br>19. The Executive Committee will provide a forum for the discussion of,
							and agreement on, issues which cut across the responsibilities of two or
							more Ministers, for prioritising executive and legislative proposals and for
							recommending a common position where necessary (e.g. in dealing with
							external relationships).
								<br><br>20. The Executive Committee will seek to agree each year, and review as
							necessary, a programme incorporating an agreed budget linked to policies
							and programmes, subject to approval by the Assembly, after scrutiny in
							Assembly Committees, on a cross-community basis.

								approval, through the arrangements in place on either side, would be
								required for decisions beyond the defined authority of those attending.
										<br><br>7. As soon as practically possible after elections to the Northern Ireland
								Assembly, inaugural meetings will take place of the Assembly, the
								British/Irish Council and the North/South Ministerial Council in their

								on this basis during the period between the elections to the Assembly, and
								the transfer of powers to the Assembly, in order to establish their modus
								operandi.
										<br><br>8. During the transitional period between the elections to the Northern
								Ireland Assembly and the transfer of power to it, representatives of the
								Northern Ireland transitional Administration and the Irish Government
								operating in the North/South Ministerial Council will undertake a work
								programme, in consultation with the British Government, covering at least

								least 6 matters for co-operation and implementation in each of the
								following categories:
								(I) Matters where existing bodies will be the appropriate mechanisms for
								co-operation in each separate jurisdiction;
								(ii) Matters where the co-operation will take place through agreed
								implementation bodies on a cross-border or all-island level.
										<br><br>10. The two Governments will make necessary legislative and other
								enabling preparations to ensure, as an absolute commitment, that these
								bodies, which have been agreed as a result of the work programme,
								function at the time of the inception of the British-Irish Agreement and
								the transfer of powers, with legislative authority for these bodies
								transferred to the Assembly as soon as possible thereafter. Other
								arrangements for the agreed co-operation will also commence
								contemporaneously with the transfer of powers to the Assembly.
										<br><br>11. The implementation bodies will have a clear operational remit. They
								will implement on an all-island and cross-border basis policies agreed in
								the Council.
										<br><br>12. Any further development of these arrangements to be by agreement in
								the Council and with the specific endorsement of the Northern Ireland
								Assembly and Oireachtas, subject to the extent of the competences and
								responsibility of the two Administrations.

								Northern Ireland Assembly are mutually inter-dependent, and that one
								cannot successfully function without the other.
										<br><br>14. Disagreements within the Council to be addressed in the format
								described at paragraph 3(iii) above or in the plenary format. By agreement
								between the two sides, experts could be appointed to consider a particular

								and proposals under consideration in the EU framework. Arrangements to
								be made to ensure that the views of the Council are taken into account and
								represented appropriately at relevant EU meetings.
										<br><br>18. The Northern Ireland Assembly and the Oireachtas to consider
								developing a joint parliamentary forum, bringing together equal numbers
								from both institutions for discussion of matters of mutual interest and
								concern.
										<br><br>19. Consideration to be given to the establishment of an independent
								consultative forum appointed by the two Administrations, representative
								of civil society, comprising the social partners and other members with
								expertise in social, cultural, economic and other issues.

								STRAND THREE
								BRITISH-IRISH COUNCIL
								<br><br>1. A British-Irish Council (BIC) will be established under a new BritishIrish Agreement to promote the harmonious and mutually beneficial
								development of the totality of relationships among the peoples of these
								islands.
								<br><br>2. Membership of the BIC will comprise representatives of the British and
								Irish Governments, devolved institutions in Northern Ireland, Scotland
								and Wales, when established, and, if appropriate, elsewhere in the United
								Kingdom, together with representatives of the Isle of Man and the
								Channel Islands.
								<br><br>3. The BIC will meet in different formats: at summit level, twice per year;
								in specific sectoral formats on a regular basis, with each side represented
								by the appropriate Minister; in an appropriate format to consider crosssectoral matters.
								<br><br>4. Representatives of members will operate in accordance with whatever
								procedures for democratic authority and accountability are in force in
								their respective elected institutions.
								<br><br>5. The BIC will exchange information, discuss, consult and use best
								endeavours to reach agreement on co-operation on matters of mutual
								interest within the competence of the relevant Administrations. Suitable
								issues for early discussion in the BIC could include transport links,
								agricultural issues, environmental issues, cultural issues, health issues,
								education issues and approaches to EU issues. Suitable arrangements to be
								made for practical co-operation on agreed policies.
								<br><br>6. It will be open to the BIC to agree common policies or common
								actions. Individual members may opt not to participate in such common
								policies and common action.
								<br><br>7. The BIC normally will operate by consensus. In relation to decisions on
tional								implementation, it will operate by agreement of all members participating
								in such policies or actions.
								<br><br>8. The members of the BIC, on a basis to be agreed between them, will
								provide such financial support as it may require.
								<br><br>9. A secretariat for the BIC will be provided by the British and Irish
								Governments in co-ordination with officials of each of the other members.
								<br><br>10. In addition to the structures provided for under this agreement, it will
								be open to two or more members to develop bilateral or multilateral
								arrangements between them. Such arrangements could include, subject to
								the agreement of the members concerned, mechanisms to enable
								consultation, co-operation and joint decision-making on matters of mutual
								interest; and mechanisms to implement any joint decisions they may
								reach. These arrangements will not require the prior approval of the BIC
								as a whole and will operate independently of it.
								<br><br>11. The elected institutions of the members will be encouraged to develop
								interparliamentary links, perhaps building on the British-Irish
								Interparliamentary Body.
								<br><br>12. The full membership of the BIC will keep under review the workings
								of the Council, including a formal published review at an appropriate time
								after the Agreement comes into effect, and will contribute as appropriate
								to any review of the overall political agreement arising from the multiparty negotiations.
								BRITISH-IRISH INTERGOVERNMENTAL CONFERENCE
								<br><br>1. There will be a new British-Irish Agreement dealing with the totality of
								relationships. It will establish a standing British-Irish Intergovernmental
								Conference, which will subsume both the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental
								Council and the Intergovernmental Conference established under the 1985
								Agreement.
								<br><br>2. The Conference will bring together the British and Irish Governments
								to promote bilateral co-operation at all levels on all matters of mutual
								interest within the competence of both Governments.
								<br><br>3. The Conference will meet as required at Summit level (Prime Minister
								and Taoiseach). Otherwise, Governments will be represented by
								appropriate Ministers. Advisers, including police and security advisers,
								will attend as appropriate.
								<br><br>4. All decisions will be by agreement between both Governments. The
								Governments will make determined efforts to resolve disagreements
								between them. There will be no derogation from the sovereignty of either
								Government.
								<br><br>5. In recognition of the Irish Government’s special interest in Northern
								Ireland and of the extent to which issues of mutual concern arise in
								relation to Northern Ireland, there will be regular and frequent meetings of
								the Conference concerned with non-devolved Northern Ireland matters, on
								which the Irish Government may put forward views and proposals. These
								meetings, to be co-chaired by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the
								Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, would also deal with all-island
								and cross-border co-operation on non-devolved issues.
								<br><br>6. Co-operation within the framework of the Conference will include
								facilitation of co-operation in security matters. The Conference also will
								address, in particular, the areas of rights, justice, prisons and policing in
								Northern Ireland (unless and until responsibility is devolved to a Northern
								Ireland administration) and will intensify co-operation between the two
								Governments on the all-island or cross-border aspects of these matters.
								<br><br>7. Relevant executive members of the Northern Ireland Administration
								will be involved in meetings of the Conference, and in the reviews
								referred to in paragraph 9 below to discuss non-devolved Northern Ireland
								matters.
								<br><br>8. The Conference will be supported by officials of the British and Irish
								Governments, including by a standing joint Secretariat of officials dealing
								with non-devolved Northern Ireland matters.
								<br><br>9. The Conference will keep under review the workings of the new
								British-Irish Agreement and the machinery and institutions established
								under it, including a formal published review three years after the
								Agreement comes into effect. Representatives of the Northern Ireland
								Administration will be invited to express views to the Conference in this
								context. The Conference will contribute as appropriate to any review of
								the overall political agreement arising from the multi-party negotiations
								but will have no power to override the democratic arrangements set up by
								this Agreement.

							<p>RIGHTS, SAFEGUARDS AND EQUALITY OF
							OPPORTUNITY
							<br><br>Human Rights
							<br><br>1. The parties affirm their commitment to the mutual respect, the civil
							rights and the religious liberties of everyone in the community. Against
							the background of the recent history of communal conflict, the parties
							affirm in particular:
							<br><br>• the right of free political thought;
							<br><br>• the right to freedom and expression of religion;
							<br><br>• the right to pursue democratically national and political aspirations;
							<br><br>• the right to seek constitutional change by peaceful and legitimate
							means;
							<br><br>• the right to freely choose one’s place of residence;
							<br><br>• the right to equal opportunity in all social and economic activity,
							regardless of class, creed, disability, gender or ethnicity;
							<br><br>• the right to freedom from sectarian harassment; and
							<br><br>• the right of women to full and equal political participation.
							United Kingdom Legislation
							<br><br>2. <mark>The British Government will complete incorporation into Northern
							Ireland law of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)</mark>, with
							direct access to the courts, and remedies for breach of the Convention,
							including power for the courts to overrule Assembly legislation on
							grounds of inconsistency.
							<br><br>3. Subject to the outcome of public consultation underway, the British
							Government intends, as a particular priority, to create a statutory
							obligation on public authorities in Northern Ireland to carry out all their
							functions with due regard to the need to promote equality of opportunity
							in relation to religion and political opinion; gender; race; disability; age;
							marital status; dependants; and sexual orientation. Public bodies would be
							required to draw up statutory schemes showing how they would
							implement this obligation. Such schemes would cover arrangements for
							policy appraisal, including an assessment of impact on relevant categories,
							public consultation, public access to information and services, monitoring
							and timetables.
							<br><br>4. <mark>The new Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission (see paragraph 5
							below) will be invited to consult and to advise on the scope for defining,
							in Westminster legislation, rights supplementary to those in the European
							Convention on Human Rights, to reflect the particular circumstances of
							Northern Ireland, drawing as appropriate on international instruments and
							experience. These additional rights to reflect the principles of mutual
							respect for the identity and ethos of both communities and parity of
							esteem, and - taken together with the ECHR - to constitute a Bill of Rights
							for Northern Ireland.</mark> Among the issues for consideration by the
							Commission will be:
							<br><br>• the formulation of a general obligation on government and public
							bodies fully to respect, on the basis of equality of treatment, the identity
							and ethos of both communities in Northern Ireland; and
							<br><br>• a clear formulation of the rights not to be discriminated against and to
							equality of opportunity in both the public and private sectors.
							New Institutions in Northern Ireland
							<br><br>5. A new Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, with membership
							from Northern Ireland reflecting the community balance, will be
							established by Westminster legislation, independent of Government, with
							an extended and enhanced role beyond that currently exercised by the
							Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights, to include keeping
							under review the adequacy and effectiveness of laws and practices,
							making recommendations to Government as necessary; providing
							information and promoting awareness of human rights; considering draft
							legislation referred to them by the new Assembly; and, in appropriate
							cases, bringing court proceedings or providing assistance to individuals
							doing so.
							<br><br>6. Subject to the outcome of public consultation currently underway, the
							British Government intends a new statutory Equality Commission to
							replace the Fair Employment Commission, the Equal Opportunities
							Commission (NI), the Commission for Racial Equality (NI) and the
							Disability Council. Such a unified Commission will advise on, validate
							and monitor the statutory obligation and will investigate complaints of
							default.
							<br><br>7. It would be open to a new Northern Ireland Assembly to consider
							bringing together its responsibilities for these matters into a dedicated
							Department of Equality.
							<br><br>8. These improvements will build on existing protections in Westminster
							legislation in respect of the judiciary, the system of justice and policing.
							Comparable Steps by the Irish Government
							<br><br>9. <mark>The Irish Government will also take steps to further strengthen the
							protection of human rights in its jurisdiction. </mark> The Government will, taking
							account of the work of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the
							Constitution and the Report of the Constitution Review Group, bring
							forward measures to strengthen and underpin the constitutional protection
							of human rights.<mark> These proposals will draw on the European Convention
							on Human Rights and other international legal instruments in the field of
							human rights and the question of the incorporation of the ECHR will be
							further examined in this context.</mark>The measures brought forward would
							ensure at least an equivalent level of protection of human rights as will
							pertain in Northern Ireland. In addition, the Irish Government will:
							<br><br>• establish a Human Rights Commission with a mandate and remit
							equivalent to that within Northern Ireland;
							<br><br>• proceed with arrangements as quickly as possible to ratify the Council
							of Europe Framework Convention on National Minorities (already
							ratified by the UK);
							<br><br>• implement enhanced employment equality legislation;
							<br><br>• introduce equal status legislation; and
							<br><br>• continue to take further active steps to demonstrate its respect for the
							different traditions in the island of Ireland.

							<br><br><b>A Joint Committee</b>
							<br><br>10. It is envisaged that there would be a joint committee of representatives
							of the two Human Rights Commissions, North and South, as a forum for
							consideration of human rights issues in the island of Ireland. The joint
							committee will consider, among other matters, the possibility of
							establishing a charter, open to signature by all democratic political parties,
							reflecting and endorsing agreed measures for the protection of the
							fundamental rights of everyone living in the island of Ireland.

									<p>11. The participants believe that it is essential to acknowledge and address
							the suffering of the victims of violence as a necessary element of
							reconciliation. They look forward to the results of the work of the
							Northern Ireland Victims Commission.
							<br><br>12.<mark> It is recognised that victims have a right to remember as well as to
							contribute to a changed society. The achievement of a peaceful and just
							society would be the true memorial to the victims of violence. </mark>The
							participants particularly recognise that young people from areas affected
							by the troubles face particular difficulties and will support the
							development of special community-based initiatives based on
							international best practice. The provision of services that are supportive
							and sensitive to the needs of victims will also be a critical element and
							that support will need to be channelled through both statutory and
							community-based voluntary organisations facilitating locally-based selfhelp and support networks. This will require the allocation of sufficient
							resources, including statutory funding as necessary, to meet the needs of
							victims and to provide for community-based support programmes.
							<br><br>13. The participants recognise and value the work being done by many
							organisations to develop reconciliation and mutual understanding and
							respect between and within communities and traditions, in Northern
							Ireland and between North and South, and they see such work as having a
							vital role in consolidating peace and political agreement. Accordingly,
							they pledge their continuing support to such organisations and will
							positively examine the case for enhanced financial assistance for the work
							of reconciliation. An essential aspect of the reconciliation process is the
							promotion of a culture of tolerance at every level of society, including
							initiatives to facilitate and encourage integrated education and mixed
							housing.</p>


							<p><strong>Economic, Social and Cultural Issues
								<br><br>
							1. Pending the devolution of powers to a new Northern Ireland Assembly,
							the British Government will pursue broad policies for sustained economic
							growth and stability in Northern Ireland and for promoting social
							inclusion, including in particular community development and the
							advancement of women in public life.
							<br><br>
							2. Subject to the public consultation currently under way, the British
							Government will make rapid progress with:
							<br>
							(i) a new regional development strategy for Northern Ireland, for
							consideration in due course by a the Assembly, tackling the problems of a
							divided society and social cohesion in urban, rural and border areas,
							protecting and enhancing the environment, producing new approaches to
							transport issues, strengthening the physical infrastructure of the region,
							developing the advantages and resources of rural areas and rejuvenating
							major urban centres;
							<br>
							(ii) a new economic development strategy for Northern Ireland, for
							consideration in due course by a the Assembly, which would provide for
							short and medium term economic planning linked as appropriate to the
							regional development strategy; and
							<br>
							(iii) measures on employment equality included in the recent White Paper
							("Partnership for Equality") and covering the extension and strengthening
							of anti-discrimination legislation, a review of the national security aspects
							of the present fair employment legislation at the earliest possible time, a
							new more focused Targeting Social Need initiative and a range of
							measures aimed at combating unemployment and progressively
							eliminating the differential in unemployment rates between the two
							communities by targeting objective need.
							<br><br>
							3. All participants recognise the importance of respect, understanding and
							tolerance in relation to linguistic diversity, including in Northern Ireland,
							the Irish language, Ulster-Scots and the languages of the various ethnic
							communities, all of which are part of the cultural wealth of the island of
							Ireland.
							<br><br>
							4. In the context of active consideration currently being given to the UK
							signing the Council of Europe Charter for Regional or Minority
							Languages, the British Government will in particular in relation to the
							Irish language, where appropriate and where people so desire it:
							<br>
							• take resolute action to promote the language;
							• facilitate and encourage the use of the language in speech and writing in
							public and private life where there is appropriate demand;
							• seek to remove, where possible, restrictions which would discourage or
							work against the maintenance or development of the language;
							• make provision for liaising with the Irish language community,
							representing their views to public authorities and investigating
							complaints;
							• place a statutory duty on the Department of Education to encourage and
							facilitate Irish medium education in line with current provision for
							integrated education;
							• explore urgently with the relevant British authorities, and in co-operation
							with the Irish broadcasting authorities, the scope for achieving more
							widespread availability of Teilifis na Gaeilige in Northern Ireland;
							• seek more effective ways to encourage and provide financial support for
							Irish language film and television production in Northern Ireland; and
							• encourage the parties to secure agreement that this commitment will be
							sustained by a new Assembly in a way which takes account of the desires
							and sensitivities of the community.
							<br><br>
							5. All participants acknowledge the sensitivity of the use of symbols and
							emblems for public purposes, and the need in particular in creating the
							new institutions to ensure that such symbols and emblems are used in a
							manner which promotes mutual respect rather than division.
							Arrangements will be made to monitor this issue and consider what action
							might be required.

							DECOMMISSIONING
							<br><br>
							1. Participants recall their agreement in the Procedural Motion adopted on
							24 September 1997 "that the resolution of the decommissioning issue is
							an indispensable part of the process of negotiation", and also recall the
							provisions of paragraph 25 of Strand 1 above.
							<br><br>
							2. They note the progress made by the Independent International
							Commission on Decommissioning and the Governments in developing
							schemes which can represent a workable basis for achieving the
							decommissioning of illegally-held arms in the possession of paramilitary
							groups.
							<br><br>
							3. <mark>All participants accordingly reaffirm their commitment to the total
							disarmament of all paramilitary organisations.</mark> They also confirm their
							intention to continue to work constructively and in good faith with the
							Independent Commission, and to use any influence they may have, to
							<mark>achieve the decommissioning of all paramilitary arms within two years
							following endorsement in referendums North and South of the agreement</mark>
							and in the context of the implementation of the overall settlement.
							<br><br>
							4. The Independent Commission will monitor, review and verify progress
							on decommissioning of illegal arms, and will report to both Governments
							at regular intervals.
								<br><br>
							6. Both Governments will take all necessary steps to facilitate the
							decommissioning process to include bringing the relevant schemes into
							force by the end of June.
								<br><br>
							SECURITY
								<br><br>
							1. The participants note that the development of a peaceful environment
							on the basis of this agreement can and should mean a normalisation of
							security arrangements and practices.
								<br><br>
							2. The British Government will make progress towards the objective of as
							early a return as possible to normal security arrangements in Northern
							Ireland, consistent with the level of threat and with a published overall
							strategy, dealing with:
								<br>
							(i) the reduction of the numbers and role of the Armed Forces deployed
									<br>
							in Northern Ireland to levels compatible with a normal peaceful society;
							(ii) the removal of security installations;
									<br>
							(iii) the removal of emergency powers in Northern Ireland; and
							(iv) other measures appropriate to and compatible with a normal
							peaceful society.
									<br>		<br>
							3. The Secretary of State will consult regularly on progress, and the
							response to any continuing paramilitary activity, with the Irish
							Government and the political parties, as appropriate.
									<br>		<br>
							4. The British Government will continue its consultation on firearms
							regulation and control on the basis of the document published on 2 April
							1998.
									<br>		<br>
							5. The Irish Government will initiate a wide-ranging review of the
							Offences Against the State Acts 1939-85 with a view to both reform and
							dispensing with those elements no longer required as circumstances
							permit.

							POLICING AND JUSTICE
									<br>		<br>
							1. The participants recognise that policing is a central issue in any society.
							They equally recognise that Northern Ireland’s history of deep divisions
							has made it highly emotive, with great hurt suffered and sacrifices made
							by many individuals and their families, including those in the RUC and
							other public servants. <mark>They believe that the agreement provides the
							opportunity for a new beginning to policing in Northern Ireland with a
							police service capable of attracting and sustaining support from the
							community as a whole. </mark>They also believe that this agreement offers a
							unique opportunity to bring about a new political dispensation which will
							recognise the full and equal legitimacy and worth of the identities, senses
							of allegiance and ethos of all sections of the community in Northern
							Ireland. They consider that this opportunity should inform and underpin
							the development of a police service representative in terms of the make-up
							of the community as a whole and which, in a peaceful environment,
							should be routinely unarmed.
								<br>	<br>
							2. <mark>The participants believe it essential that policing structures and
							arrangements are such that the police service is professional, effective and
							efficient, fair and impartial, free from partisan political control;
							accountable, both under the law for its actions and to the community it
							serves; representative of the society it polices, and operates within a
							coherent and co-operative criminal justice system, which conforms with
							human rights norms.</mark> The participants also believe that those structures
							and arrangements must be capable of maintaining law and order including
							responding effectively to crime and to any terrorist threat and to public
							order problems. A police service which cannot do so will fail to win
							public confidence and acceptance. They believe that any such structures
							and arrangements should be capable of delivering a policing service, in
							constructive and inclusive partnerships with the community at all levels,
							and with the maximum delegation of authority and responsibility,
							consistent with the foregoing principles. These arrangements should be
							based on principles of protection of human rights and professional
							integrity and should be unambiguously accepted and actively supported
							by the entire community.
							<br>	<br>
							3. An independent Commission will be established to make
							recommendations for future policing arrangements in Northern Ireland
							including means of encouraging widespread community support for these
							arrangements within the agreed framework of principles reflected in the
							paragraphs above and in accordance with the terms of reference at <br><br>Annex
							A.
							<br>	The Commission will be broadly representative with expert and
							international representation among its membership and will be asked to
							consult widely and to report no later than Summer 1999.
							<br>	<br>
							4. The participants believe that the aims of the criminal justice system are
							to:
							<br>
							• deliver a fair and impartial system of justice to the community;
							<br>
							• be responsive to the community’s concerns, and encouraging community
							involvement where appropriate;
							<br>
							• have the confidence of all parts of the community; and
							<br>
							• deliver justice efficiently and effectively.
							<br><br>
							5. There will be a parallel wide-ranging review of criminal justice (other
							than policing and those aspects of the system relating to the emergency
							legislation) to be carried out by the British Government through a
							mechanism with an independent element, in consultation with the political
							parties and others. The review will commence as soon as possible, will
							include wide consultation, and a report will be made to the Secretary of
							State no later than Autumn 1999. Terms of Reference are attached at
							<br><br>
						<p>Annex B.
							6. Implementation of the recommendations arising from both reviews will
							be discussed with the political parties and with the Irish Government.
							<br><br>
							7. The participants also note that the British Government remains ready in
							principle, with the broad support of the political parties, and after
							consultation, as appropriate, with the Irish Government, in the context of
							ongoing implementation of the relevant recommendations, to devolve
							responsibility for policing and justice issues.
							<br><br>
							<br><br>Annex A
							<br><br>
							COMMISSION ON POLICING FOR NORTHERN
							IRELAND
							<br><br>
							Terms of Reference
							<br><br>
							Taking account of the principles on policing as set out in the agreement,
							the Commission will inquire into policing in Northern Ireland and, on the
							basis of its findings, bring forward proposals for future policing structures
							and arrangements, including means of encouraging widespread
							community support for those arrangements.
							<br><br>
							Its proposals on policing should be designed to ensure that policing
							arrangements, including composition, recruitment, training, culture, ethos
							and symbols, are such that in a new approach Northern Ireland has a
							police service that can enjoy widespread support from, and is seen as an
							integral part of, the community as a whole.
							<br><br>
							Its proposals should include recommendations covering any issues such as
							re-training, job placement and educational and professional development
							required in the transition to policing in a peaceful society.
							Its proposals should also be designed to ensure that:
							<br>
							• the police service is structured, managed and resourced so that it can be
							effective in discharging its full range of functions (including proposals on
							any necessary arrangements for the transition to policing in a normal
							peaceful society);
							<br>
							• the police service is delivered in constructive and inclusive partnerships
							with the community at all levels with the maximum delegation of
							authority and responsibility;
							<br>
							• the legislative and constitutional framework requires the impartial
							discharge of policing functions and conforms with internationally
							accepted norms in relation to policing standards;
							• the police operate within a clear framework of accountability to the law
							and the community they serve, so:
							<br>
							• they are constrained by, accountable to and act only within the law;
							• their powers and procedures, like the law they enforce, are clearly
							established and publicly available;
							<br>
							• there are open, accessible and independent means of investigating and
							adjudicating upon complaints against the police;
							<br>
							• there are clearly established arrangements enabling local people, and
							their political representatives, to articulate their views and concerns about
							policing and to establish publicly policing priorities and influence policing
							policies, subject to safeguards to ensure police impartiality and freedom
							from partisan political control;
							<br>
							• there are arrangements for accountability and for the effective, efficient
							and economic use of resources in achieving policing objectives;
							<br>
							• there are means to ensure independent professional scrutiny and
							inspection of the police service to ensure that proper professional
							standards are maintained;
							<br>
							• the scope for structured co-operation with the Garda Siochana and other
							police forces is addressed; and
							<br>
							• the management of public order events which can impose exceptional
							demands on policing resources is also addressed.
							<br><br>
							The Commission should focus on policing issues, but if it identifies other
							aspects of the criminal justice system relevant to its work on policing,
							including the role of the police in prosecution, then it should draw the
							attention of the Government to those matters.
							<br><br>
							The Commission should consult widely, including with non-governmental
							expert organisations, and through such focus groups as they consider it
							appropriate to establish.
							<br><br>
							The Government proposes to establish the Commission as soon as
							possible, with the aim of it starting work as soon as possible and
							publishing its final report by Summer 1999.

							<br><br>Annex B
							<br><br>
							REVIEW OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM
							<br><br>
							Terms of Reference
							<br>
							Taking account of the aims of the criminal justice system as set out in the
							Agreement, the review will address the structure, management and
							resourcing of publicly funded elements of the criminal justice system and
							will bring forward proposals for future criminal justice arrangements
							(other than policing and those aspects of the system relating to emergency
							legislation, which the Government is considering separately) covering
							such issues as:
							<br>
							• the arrangements for making appointments to the judiciary and
							magistracy, and safeguards for protecting their independence;
							<br>
							• the arrangements for the organisation and supervision of the
							prosecution process, and for safeguarding its independence;
							<br>
							• measures to improve the responsiveness and accountability of, and any
							lay participation in the criminal justice system;
							<br>
							• mechanisms for addressing law reform;
							<br>
							• the scope for structured co-operation between the criminal justice
							agencies on both parts of the island; and
							<br>
							• the structure and organisation of criminal justice functions that might be
							devolved to an Assembly, including the possibility of establishing a
							Department of Justice, while safeguarding the essential independence of
							many of the key functions in this area.
							<br>
							• The Government proposes to commence the review as soon as possible,
							consulting with the political parties and others, including non-
							governmental expert organisations. The review will be completed by
							Autumn 1999.
							<br><br>
							PRISONERS
							<br><br>
							1. <mark>Both Governments will put in place mechanisms to provide for an
							accelerated programme for the release of prisoners, including transferred
							prisoners, convicted of scheduled offences in Northern Ireland or, in the
							case of those sentenced outside Northern Ireland, similar offences</mark>
							(referred to hereafter as qualifying prisoners). Any such arrangements will
							protect the rights of individual prisoners under national and international
							law.
							<br><br>
							2. Prisoners affiliated to organisations which have not established or are
							not maintaining a complete and unequivocal ceasefire will not benefit
							from the arrangements. The situation in this regard will be kept under
							review.
							<br><br>
							3. Both Governments will complete a review process within a fixed time
							frame and set prospective release dates for all qualifying prisoners. The
							review process would provide for the advance of the release dates of
							qualifying prisoners while allowing account to be taken of the seriousness
							of the offences for which the person was convicted and the need to protect
							the community. In addition, the intention would be that should the
							circumstances allow it, any qualifying prisoners who remained in custody
							two years after the commencement of the scheme would be released at
							that point.
							<br><br>
							4. The Governments will seek to enact the appropriate legislation to give
							effect to these arrangements by the end of June 1998.
							<br><br>
							5. The Governments continue to recognise the importance of measures to
							facilitate the reintegration of prisoners into the community by providing
							support both prior to and after release, including assistance directed
							towards availing of employment opportunities, re-training and/or reskilling, and further education.

<div class="content">
<p>Validation and Implementation
	<br><br>
1. The two Governments will as soon as possible sign a new British-Irish
Agreement replacing the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement, embodying
understandings on constitutional issues and affirming their solemn
commitment to support and, where appropriate, implement the agreement
reached by the participants in the negotiations which shall be Annexed to
the British-Irish Agreement.
<br><br>
2. Each Government will organise a referendum on 22 May 1998. Subject
to Parliamentary approval, a consultative referendum in Northern Ireland,
organised under the terms of the Northern Ireland (Entry to Negotiations,
etc.) Act 1996, will address the question: "Do you support the agreement
reached in the multi-party talks on Northern Ireland and set out in
Command Paper 3883?". The Irish Government will introduce and
support in the Oireachtas a Bill to amend the Constitution as described in
paragraph 2 of the section "Constitutional Issues" and in <br><br>Annex B, as
follows: (a) to amend Articles 2 and 3 as described in paragraph 8.1 in
<br><br>Annex B above and (b) to amend Article 29 to permit the Government to
ratify the new British-Irish Agreement. On passage by the Oireachtas, the
Bill will be put to referendum.
<br><br>
3. If majorities of those voting in each of the referendums support this
agreement, the Governments will then introduce and support, in their
respective Parliaments, such legislation as may be necessary to give effect
to all aspects of this agreement, and will take whatever ancillary steps as
may be required including the holding of elections on 25 June, subject to
parliamentary approval, to the Assembly, which would meet initially in a
"shadow" mode. The establishment of the North-South Ministerial
Council, implementation bodies, the British-Irish Council and the BritishIrish Intergovernmental Conference and the assumption by the Assembly
of its legislative and executive powers will take place at the same time on
the entry into force of the British-Irish Agreement.
<br><br>
4. In the interim, aspects of the implementation of the multi-party
agreement will be reviewed at meetings of those parties relevant in the
particular case (taking into account, once Assembly elections have been
held, the results of those elections), under the chairmanship of the British
Government or the two Governments, as may be appropriate; and
representatives of the two Governments and all relevant parties may meet
under independent chairmanship to review implementation of the
agreement as a whole.
<br><br>
Review procedures following implementation
<br><br>
5. Each institution may, at any time, review any problems that may arise
in its operation and, where no other institution is affected, take remedial
action in consultation as necessary with the relevant Government or
Governments. It will be for each institution to determine its own
procedures for review.
<br><br>
6. If there are difficulties in the operation of a particular institution, which
have implications for another institution, they may review their operations
separately and jointly and agree on remedial action to be taken under their
respective authorities.
<br><br>
7. If difficulties arise which require remedial action across the range of
institutions, or otherwise require amendment of the British-Irish
Agreement or relevant legislation, the process of review will fall to the
two Governments in consultation with the parties in the Assembly. Each
Government will be responsible for action in its own jurisdiction.
<br><br>
8. Notwithstanding the above, each institution will publish an annual
report on its operations. In addition, the two Governments and the parties
in the Assembly will convene a conference 4 years after the agreement
comes into effect, to review and report on its operation.
<br>
AGREEMENT
BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF
THE UNITED KINGDOM OF
GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
AND
THE GOVERNMENT
OF IRELAND
<br><br>
The British and Irish Governments:
<br>
Welcoming the strong commitment to the Agreement reached on 10th
April 1998 by themselves and other participants in the multi-party talks
and set out in Annex 1 to this Agreement (hereinafter "the Multi-Party
Agreement");
<br>
Considering that the Multi-Party Agreement offers an opportunity for a
new beginning in relationships within Northern Ireland, within the island
of Ireland and between the peoples of these islands;
Wishing to develop still further the unique relationship between their
peoples and the close co-operation between their countries as friendly
neighbours and as partners in the European Union;
Reaffirming their total commitment to the principles of democracy and
non-violence which have been fundamental to the multi-party talks;
Reaffirming their commitment to the principles of partnership, equality
and mutual respect and to the protection of civil, political, social,
economic and cultural rights in their respective jurisdictions;
Have agreed as follows:
<br>
ARTICLE 1<br>
The two Governments:
<br>
(i) recognise the legitimacy of whatever choice is freely exercised by a
majority of the people of Northern Ireland with regard to its status,
whether they prefer to continue to support the Union with Great Britain or
a sovereign united Ireland;
<br>
(ii) recognise that it is for the people of the island of Ireland alone, by
agreement between the two parts respectively and without external
impediment, to exercise their right of self-determination on the basis of
consent, freely and concurrently given, North and South, to bring about a
united Ireland, if that is their wish, accepting that this right must be
achieved and exercised with and subject to the agreement and consent of a
majority of the people of Northern Ireland;
<br>
(iii) acknowledge that while a substantial section of the people in
Northern Ireland share the legitimate wish of a majority of the people of
the island of Ireland for a united Ireland, the present wish of a majority of
the people of Northern Ireland, freely exercised and legitimate, is to
maintain the Union and accordingly, that Northern Ireland’s status as part
of the United Kingdom reflects and relies upon that wish; and that it
would be wrong to make any change in the status of Northern Ireland save
with the consent of a majority of its people;
<br>
(iv) affirm that, if in the future, the people of the island of Ireland exercise
their right of self-determination on the basis set out in sections (i) and (ii)
above to bring about a united Ireland, it will be a binding obligation on
both Governments to introduce and support in their respective Parliaments
legislation to give effect to that wish;
<br>
(v) affirm that whatever choice is freely exercised by a majority of the
people of Northern Ireland, the power of the sovereign government with
jurisdiction there shall be exercised with rigorous impartiality on behalf of
all the people in the diversity of their identities and traditions and shall be
founded on the principles of full respect for, and equality of, civil,
political, social and cultural rights, of freedom from discrimination for all
citizens, and of parity of esteem and of just and equal treatment for the
identity, ethos and aspirations of both communities;
<br>
(vi) recognise the birthright of all the people of Northern Ireland to
identify themselves and be accepted as Irish or British, or both, as they
may so choose, and accordingly confirm that their right to hold both
British and Irish citizenship is accepted by both Governments and would
not be affected by any future change in the status of Northern Ireland.
<br><br>
ARTICLE 2
<br>
The two Governments affirm their solemn commitment to support, and
where appropriate implement, the provisions of the Multi-Party
Agreement. In particular there shall be established in accordance with the
provisions of the Multi-Party Agreement immediately on the entry into
force of this Agreement, the following institutions:
<br>
(i) a North/South Ministerial Council;
<br>
(ii) the implementation bodies referred to in paragraph 9
<br>(ii) of the section
entitled "Strand Two" of the Multi-Party Agreement;
<br>
(iii) a British-Irish Council;
<br>
(iv) a British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.
<br><br>
ARTICLE 3
<br>
(1) This Agreement shall replace the Agreement between the British and
Irish Governments done at Hillsborough on 15th November 1985 which
shall cease to have effect on entry into force of this Agreement.
<br><br>
(2) The Intergovernmental Conference established by Article 2 of the
aforementioned Agreement done on 15th November 1985 shall cease to
exist on entry into force of this Agreement.
<br><br>
ARTICLE 4
<br><br>
(1) It shall be a requirement for entry into force of this Agreement that:
<br>
(a) British legislation shall have been enacted for the purpose of
implementing the provisions of Annex A to the section entitled
"Constitutional Issues" of the Multi-Party Agreement;
<br>
(b) the amendments to the Constitution of Ireland set out in Annex B to
the section entitled "Constitutional Issues" of the Multi-Party Agreement
shall have been approved by Referendum;
<br>
(c) such legislation shall have been enacted as may be required to
establish the institutions referred to in Article 2 of this Agreement.
<br><br>
(2) Each Government shall notify the other in writing of the completion,
so far as it is concerned, of the requirements for entry into force of this
Agreement. This Agreement shall enter into force on the date of the
receipt of the later of the two notifications.
<br><br>
(3) Immediately on entry into force of this Agreement, the Irish
Government shall ensure that the amendments to the Constitution of
Ireland set out in Annex B to the section entitled "Constitutional Issues"
of the Multi-Party Agreement take effect.
<br>
In witness thereof the undersigned, being duly authorised thereto by the
respective Governments, have signed this Agreement.
<br>
Done in two originals at Belfast on the 10th day of April 1998.

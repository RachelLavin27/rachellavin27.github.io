No one was hurt.\n<br>\nThree days later on the 22nd of August the Coshquinn customs post was bombed overnight. The explosion practically demolished the inside of the building, blowing out the rear windows.\n<br>\nThree months later, on Monday afternoon on the 1st of November 1972 shots were fired at soldiers 500 yards from the border and again an hour later at Strabane Old Road.\n<br>\nLater that month on the 22nd of November 1972, the UDA planted a bomb near this crossing that exploded outside a garage. A man and three children were injured by flying glass. A spokesman for the UDA said the bomb was in retaliation to the IRA storing explosives in housing estates in Buncrana.\n<br>\nOn Friday October 26th, a cylinder containing wires and explosives were found near the customs post.\n<br>\nIn October 1990, an IRA bombing of the Coshquinn Checkpoint killed five members of the British army\nAnd one civilian.\n<br>\nOn the 16th of September, 1994 100 people took part in a 'border buster campaign' removing border barriers overnight at three locations.\n<br>\nFour days later, on the 20th of September 1994 a bomb was planted 800 metres from the Coshquinn checkpoint. The bomb was discovered by children playing in a field and safely detonated by the British army. Sinn Fein blamed loyalist individuals targeting their border removal campaign.\n<br>\nOn the 23rd of December 1995, a bomb planted on the Buncrana road, believed to have been targeted at a passing army patrol, ended up narrowly missing a family of two parents and three children on their way to a Christmas party. This came one week after the signing of the Downing Street Declaration.",

    "history":"This crossing bridges a small river.<br>\nIn July 1971 it was the site of a major thwarted booby trap At least six bombs weighing 234 lbs were laid across Killea reservoir in what army personnel called 'a massive booby trap'. The bombs were discovered laid along an army patrol route. There were suspected of being laid by up to ten men with one suspect chased from the scene on its discovery. The bombs were safely detonated by the British army.\n<br>\nThe following October, it became one of the first roads to be cratered by the British army in an attempt to close unapproved roads on the border.\nA team of five soldiers used 70lbs of plastic explosives to blow a 12 foot crater in the road while 100 soldiers covered them from surrounding fields.\n<br>\nIn December 1972, soldiers traveling in a 4 ton truck came under heavy fire from three gunmen on the border. They returned fire, injuring one.",

    "history":"This crossing became the site of violent tensions between residents from towns on either side (Lifford and Strabane) while the customs post in the middle, despite numerous attempts to place barriers and obstacles, was bombed and burnt down repeatedly. \n<br>\nAt 5am on a Tuesday morning in January 1971, the Lifford road station and frontier post were heavily bombed. Residents in the local area described it as ‘the loudest they had ever heard’ with the Donegal Democrat reporting that “not a plate glass window is intact in the town as a result’. \n<br>\nIn March, a newly installed security barrier was bombed. The barrier was erected to seal the border to traffic in an emergency as the bridge had become a ‘favourite escape route’ particularly after bank raids.<br>\n That April there was a bomb hoax at the crossing.\n<br>\nIn September of that year the replacement customs hut was wrecked after a number of masked men held customs men at gunpoint, planting two gelignite bombs inside which exploded, wrecking the hut and and slightly injuring two passers-by.\n<br>\nIn the aftermath of the bomb a crowd gathered, stoning the military patrol when it arrived and smashing windows in Strabane. A bomb was hurled at a local garage, causing considerable damage.\n<br>\nIn October, the bridge was the scene of a bus hi-jacking when an armed man commandeered a mini-bus of 15 people travelling from Draperstown to take him across the border. The bus was flagged through the customs post at Lifford and later abandoned.\n<br>\nIn November,  a young woman was shot in the head and died after becoming caught up in gunfire at the crossing. As she walked across the bridge, shots were fired at the British army who were building a ramp at the border to slow traffic with a large number of troops present. The shots, which reportedly came from across the border resulted in  the woman, a waitress at a Donegal Hotel, being killed.\n That evening a group or about 50 youths threw stones at troops and attempted to remove the ramp with pick-axes but were repelled by British troops with rubber bullets and gas canisters. A bus was hijacked on the Northern side and set alight.\n<br>\nA young man also died after being struck by a rubber bullet during clashes at the army checkpoint. He died due to asphyxia brought on by the injuries received as a result of being shot at a close distance.\n<br>\nIn February 1972 the customs post was completely demolished in an explosion carried out by three masked gunmen. <br>\n That same month a van carrying English Sunday newspapers was hi-jacked by three men, the newspapers burnt and thrown in the river.\n\nBetween June 1971 and March 1972 further barriers to the ramp were set up, including a steel barrier the Strabane Chronicle claimed was erected in secret,  and concrete blocks and permanent ‘pill blocks’ facing traffic to make an S-turn at minimal speed. “Since the new barricade has been erected earlier this week there have been two shooting incidents across the border”, the Chronicle reported.\n\nIn December 1972 a crowd of 50 people crossed the border from Strabane and according to the Ulster Herald, threw petrol bombs at the Lifford Customs post - starting a fire in the wooden building.\n\nIn November 1973, loyalist extremists placed a car-bomb on the bridge, exploding and causing structural damage to the bridge.\n\nAt one point an army torch was also planted at the checkpoint by the Strabane provisional IRA - the torch would detonate on being turned on however it did not succeed in exploding.\n\nOn August 1974, 60 people had to be evacuated after a suitcase bomb was left outside a pub on Lifford’s Main St. It was safely detonated.\n\nOn January 25 1975, Lifford Customs post was bombed, damaging a nearby shop and filling station.\n\n\nIn April, 1980, a civilian travelling across the bridge by car was shot dead. A 19 year old soldier discharged his rifle as the car approached the crossing. The victim, a nurse in Strabane hospital, was returning home with her husband and relatives after celebrating her silver wedding anniversary. She was killed instantly. Said her husband of the incident “I looked round to see if everything was alright in the back. Then I saw my wife. She was lying there, struck down dead. <br> In July 1985, a bomb attack planted by the Provisional IRA injured three policemen and seven civilians on the Strabane-Lifford border. A half ton of explosives was detonated 50 yards from the bridge’s ‘camel’s hump’ ramp as an RUC Landrover passed the checkpoint. Shops and businesses were damaged by the blast and staff and patients in Lifford Hospital were showered with glass when the windows were blown in.   <br>These are just a small sample of incidents at the Lifford bridge crossing and its surrounding areas.",

The Ulster Herald reported that Council workmen sent the scene were shot at from across the border however local people filled in the crater for unofficial use. <br> Other attempts by the British army to crater unapproved roads nearby with diggers were met with snipers from the southern side and after both dispersed, locals from both sides of the river reportedly came together to fill in the craters with a bulldozer commandeered from a local building site.\n<br>\nIn March 1972 a Unionist MP claimed the neighbouring  Lifford Bridge and Clady Bridge were being used as ‘boltholes’ by the IRA.\n<br>\nIn April, 1972, after the Gardai stopped armed men parked at the border who then fled to the northern side of the border. A crowd then stoned the Gardai and a British Army helicopter was also fired on.\n<br>\nIn December 1973, a 21 year old man died in a bomb explosion at Clady bridge while a second young man was seriously injured in the blast. The IRA later confirmed the bomb was ‘for use against the British forces in the North’ but had prematurely exploded when being carried by the young man.\n<br>\n The next day, on Sunday afternoon, an hour-long gun battle took place between IRA men and British soldiers also took place at Clady Bridge.\n",

    "history":"In October 1970 complaints were made to the Home Office that British troops were ‘criss-crossing’ the border into Co. Donegal.\n<br>\nA year later, in October 1971, approx 100 British army soldiers were cratering local road crossings when they reportedly came under attack with automatic gunfire. The British army returned fire. Local people reported to the Strabane Weekly News that two soldiers were wounded and taken away in tenders. The army reported that one gunman was hit. Once the army withdrew the Donegal Democrat reported that “Immediately the local people on both sides of the Border commandeered a bulldozer from a nearby building site and filled in the craters”. A ceremonial tape was cut by Senator Bernard McGlinchey and a Tricolour was hoisted.\n<br>\nLater that evening a bus was hi-jacked by two masked gunmen who set it ablaze at the site of the cratering.\n<br>\nIn February 1972, an Ulsterbus was again hijacked when the bus driver was held at gunpoint,  and instructed to drive to the border where the bus was set alight. The bus was to take shift workers to Herdman’s mill at Sion mill. The Provisional IRA denied involvement.\n\nIn March 1994, the crossing was the site of a failed mortar attack after the British army found. 25 families from the surrounding area had to be evacuated as the bomb, which was packed with between 200 and 300 pounds of home-made explosives - was safely detonated.\n",

    "history":"In October 1970 the Donegal Democrat reported that British Troops repeatedly crossed the border with Kilclean Crossing a ‘point of persistent invasion’.\n<br>\nIn March 1971, the northern customs post was damaged by a hand grenade. Ten days later the Irish customs post at Kilclean was set on fire, supposedly by a petrol bomb.\n<br>\nIn May, the British customs post was bombed again from a suspected grenade ‘lobbed through the window of the post, possible from a passing car’.\n<br>\nIn September the British Customs post was bombed yet again. Just after 5pm a group of six men, two of whom were armed, crossed the border, broke in the door and planted a 20lb bomb, which, on explosion, wrecked the building. A local man recalled witnessing the attack from his home on the Northern side of the border in the Strabane Weekly News. “I suspected that they were planting a bomb and I ran out to the back of my house and lay down. I was just there a minute when there was a loud bang and rubble was scattered over a wide area,” he said.\n<br>\nIn August, 1973, a car wreckage and two bodies were discovered 100 years from the Killclen customs post, with one man’s remains inside the ruins and the other thirty yards from the scene in a plantation. It was suspected the two men died when the car they were travelling in exploded. The IRA claimed they were members of the organisation and although the cause of the blast was not determined, the Ulster Herald reported it was suspected they may have been transporting explosives which went off prematurely.\n<br>\nIn March 1974, during a weekend in which 30 cars were hijacked in Derry, a motorist approaching the Kilclean border was wounded in the foot after refusing to stop his car for an armed man who came out of the ditch with his face darkened and tried to stop him. \n\n",

They used heavy equipment and shovels to clear the road of its cement bollards and other obstacles that had been put in place. \n<br>\nThe RUC responded by digging up the road in several places to render it impassable however the following Saturday two doze local people gathered again and reopened the same stretch of road.

    "history":"In June 1969 a local farmer was found with serious head injuries in the middle of the Termon bridge. He was removed to hospital where he later died. The dead man was a 59-year-old father-of-ten. However as the border between Tyrone and Fermanagh runs down the middle of the bridge police had to call in a county engineer to decide if he had been found in Northern Ireland or the Republic before the appropriate policing body could investigate.  The Fermanagh Herald reported that “After an examination of some bloodstains Mr. Brady was able to establish that it was Northern Ireland, but only by a couple of feet”.\n<br>This road was cratered by the British army although later filled in by blocks. <br>\nIn a scoping report in 1993 it was considered a high priority for closure by the British army who claimed it was used in 1987 as an escape route for ‘terrorists after the murder’ of a man in Edemey.",

The small village has four churches (Roman Catholic, Church of Ireland, Presbyterian and Methodist), three war memorials (Crimea, the first World War and the War of Independence) and two names (in the north it is Tullyhommon). <br> It has long been rumoured that Pettigo was the inspiration for Spike Milligan’s book that was later made into a film \"Puckoon\". The comic novel depicts a small town split literally down the middle by the bumbling border commission, which fought over the pencil, thus pulling the dreaded line through the middle of pub and graveyard. <br> During the Troubles the Pettigo border was a concession road.<br>On the 8th of September 1973 the border became the target of a seige when eight armed men took over the Northern side of Pettigo Village lining local men, women and children against a wall at gunpoint for half an hour. Their names and religion were  demanded while bombs were planted. A 13 year old schoolboy was shot by a stray bullet after a local man who was a part-time member of the  UDR ran from the siege and was shot at by the gunmen. He returned to the scene with a gun, returning gunfire and the gunmen fled.  Later a British army sergeant, sent to diffuse the bomb placed in the local post office, was killed instantly when it exploded. The British customs post and and local garage were also blown up. <br>\n",

    "history":"In November 1971 shots were fired over the border at the RUC station. The Irish Times reported that four gun men, including one at the end of a bridge, shot at the station with at least one-machine gun used. 100s of workers leaving Belleek pottery at the time were caught in the gunfire and had to run for cover.\n<br>\nThat same month, this bridge, previously a concession road, was blown up by the British army on the Northern Ireland side in order to block it.\nThe Donegal Democrat reported at the time that the British customs station had been destroyed and the caravans that replaced it were burnt down 11 times.\n<br>\nIn December 1971 armed men stole £4500 of wages from a member of staff of the Belleek Pottery Company as he carried wages from the bank. His car was rammed, the cash stolen and the men ran across the bridge, stealing another car at gunpoint before making off into Co. Donegal.\n<br>\n\nIn September 1974, a car was hijacked at Letter bridge and its driver was ordered to drive a bomb to a garage in Kesh. Instead, the driver drove only a short distance before notifying the gardai and the RUC. The two gardai who were sent to investigate the incident came under fire from the north side of the border and the armed men escaped. The hi-jacked car was later found abandoned near Ballyshannon where the British Army safely detonated it.\n<br>\nIn March 1983, a woman claimed she was dragged over the border by RUC officers for arrest at a bridge near here. The woman, a 39-year old republican, was faced with an exclusion order in Northern Ireland and so reportedly waited at the bridge on the southern side of the border while her children enjoyed the St. Patricks Day Parade in Belleek. The Donegal Democrat reported an RUC officer ‘seized’ her at the bridge, ‘dragging her into Fermanagh’ where, in a scuffle, an RUC man discharged a shot, injuring another woman in the leg. The police claimed it was the arrested woman who fired the shot.\n<br>\nIn July 1987 a British soldier was shot by snipers bullet as he and eight other soldiers were on foot patrol at the Carlton Hotel, just off the bridge on the Northern Ireland side. The sniper was believed to have hid himself in a path just off the bridge on the southern side.\n<br>\n\nIn October 1988 two ‘beer-keg bombs’ containing more than 100lb of home-made explosives and shrapnel were  left at the bridge. After a five day bomb alert they were safely defused.",

Shots were fired at a British army patrol but although road blocks were set up at the border crossing no one was apprehended. Five further customs caravan were reported to have been burnt the following month of December in quick succession.\n<br>\nLater that month, the Donegal Democrat reported that ‘the twelfth caravan serving as temporary accommodation for British Custom men at the Belleek frontier went up in flames on Saturday morning last.” Customs officials had taken to transporting the customs van out of the area each evening however on Saturday morning the transfer was interrupted by a group of armed men who placed it across the road and lit it on fire along with the car towing it.\n<br><br>In April 1972 the customs caravan was set alight yet again.\n<br>\nIn August 1972, a British military escort helping men transport wages to Belleek Pottery  were fired upon from across the border.

    "history":"In November 1971 locals attempted to remove concrete slabs that had been placed on the road. The Donegal Democrat reported that the British army arrived on the scene, crossed onto the southern side and assaulted one man and arrested others, later training their guns on Gardai who also came to the scene, prompting a protest from the Taoiseach to the British Ambassador.<br>\n That same month the British army attempted to trench the crossing and were met with gunfire from the South. A short gun battle ensued, prompting a retreat from the British army. When they returned later a gun battled began again, lasting for over an hour. No one was reported to have been injured.\n<br>\nIn February 1973 200 people came to the site to fill in the craters with rubble from a nearby abandoned house.<br>\n A different type of standoff arose again at the crossing in September 1994, this time where locals wanted to keep the crossing closed. Protestors forcibly reopening border crossings were met by locals claiming to represent the wishes of the people in the local area who said they did not want the border to be reopened until the British and Irish governments gave the go ahead. This was to avoid delaying the legal opening of the road and more broadly meant not endangering a ceasefire that was gradually opening border roads despite protests that it was too slow by Sinn Fein supporters. “There is no excuse for closure of these roads…in this age of European integration’ said one Leitrim Sinn Fein representative. One woman held a signal the passive protest that said “Save our bridge in Peace, not in pieces’ as a local councillor tried to tackle the road block with a jack hammer. The Protestors succeeded in reopening the bridge but it was closed within 24 hours by the British army.<br>\n The road was finally officially opened in October 1994 with the Fermanagh Herald reporting “cars were bumper to bumper, travelling both ways all weekend as locals couldn’t believe what was happening - a wonderful new future for the area on the way.”\n\n",

    "history":"This border was blown up in 1975. The Leitrim Champion reported at the time that Leitrim County Council protested the British action, ‘calling it an act of War’. \n<br>\nIt also reportedly isolated the local protestant community on the North of the border from their local church. However, a footbridge was put in place to help locals cross the border safely after two fatalities occurred when locals attempted to cross the cratered bridge.\n<br>\nHowever debris from the blast blocked the river with steel and stones causing flood damage which at times made the bridge ineffective. The Sligo Champion reported that seven families with children attending the local school had to cross the river bed when floods occurred which was reportedly highly dangerous at the time.\n<br>\n\n\nAccording to the Fermanagh Herald the British army would fly in soldiers via helicopter two or three times a week to the Kiltycogher area where ‘they occupy observation posts on the top of Scrabbagh Hill which offers an uninterrupted view of Kiltyclogher’s neat streets and surrounding countrysides’ and that ‘helicopters flying at night, regularly use searchlights to sweep the country lanes for signs of movement.’\n<br>\n\nThe bridge was rebuilt and reopened in 1995. It was met with eager anticipation by the local Cashel Community group who claimed the bridge closure leads to diversions which separated the border community. On its reopening they commented in the Fermanagh Herald  “There is so much work to be done because the young people of the area don’t even know their neighbours who live a mile down the road and the older generation will want to renew old acquaintances with whom they lost contact.” The Leitrim Observer declared in a headline “Kiltyclogher no longer a ‘cul-de-sac”.\n",

As climbing up the tree was considered too dangerous the tree and flag were blown up.”\n<br>\nIn 1991 the border crossing was reopened by over 60 people however later it was re-closed in a blasting/excavation operation by British troops.\n<br>\nA scoping report on the border crossings published by the British army in 1993 claimed the crossing had been ‘used by terrorists in several attacks and murders’, the latest being the murder of a sergeant in Enniskillen on the 3rd of  March 1985.",

    "history":"In October 1971 the British army placed 8 ramps on the border road, six of which were removed by local people. The border was closed for a time in 1972. <br>In February 1972, the Anglo Celt reported an incursion of two British armoured cars into the South.<br>  In November 1972, a gun battle erupted between the British military who were maintaining a road block and armed men.  The Anglo Celt reported it ‘went on in bright moonlight close on a half-hour’.\n<br>In December 1972, a rocket attack was launched at the checkpoint at 4.35pm on a Monday. It was targeted at a British army vehicle sitting 200 yards from the border, missing and landing in a field beside the road. It was followed by a gun-battle in which British troops came under small arms fire. No one was reported injured although the missile reportedly landed near a local farmer tending to his cattle, ‘giving him a shock’.<br>\nA house sitting on the border was split in two with one half in the north and the other in the South. \n<br>A Sunday Independent article in 1970 reported on the nature of the divide in the area, referring to the area as ‘a geographical cultural de sac’ causing ‘situations which would be amusing if they were not infuriating’. Anyone caught passing unapproved roads faced hefty fines yet the northern customs closed at 5 and the southern at 8. Churchoers crossing the border were given a concession pass during stated hours and clergymen could use the road while ‘on their lawful business’ but not carry goods or passengers. A funeral carrying a deceased person could cross the border but the profession of cars would have to take a detour. The article was titled ‘It’s not funny’. Say border men in which they called for the opening up of the roads.",

    "history":"Garda Inspector Sammy Donegal, of Cavan Garda station, was killed in a bomb explosion on the Cavan-Fermanagh Border near Legakelly on June 8th, 1972. <br>A wooden box had been placed on the road with a placard nearby reading bomb in large lettering. Motorists turned back on the road, alerting athourities. It had been thought, accordin to The Anglo Celt, that the bomb was a trap to lure british soldiers into the area so the IRA could ambush them there. However, when the Garda went a few yards across the border to inspect it, the bomb exploded seriously injuring Inspector Donegan and woulding another Lieutenant. He later died from his injuries.",

    "history":"In January 1972 The Anglo Celt described a ‘battle of the roads’ as locals fought to keep roads open in the Clones area, refilling in cratered roads. It claimed the road had been blasted six times and filled in again by locals, using even an abandoned hijacked Ulsterbus to fill the crater. The road closures, it said, had ’virtually cut off (Drumilly) from the rest of Co. Monaghan.’ <br> In June 1992, The Northern Standard described a tense confrontation near this border road when nine British soldiers who had crossed into the Republic were challenged by local people working on the bog. The paper reported that following a heated confrontation between the two parties that lasted 15 minutes the soldiers took up a firing position, which included pointing a gun at a twelve year old girl. It goes on “Everybody, including about thirty people working in the Derrybeg bog about a quarter of a mile from the Border, armed themselves with turf.” The standoff ended after an hour when the soldiers decided to leave the area.",

    "history":"This bridge was blown up by the British army on the 20th of October 1971. It was then rebuilt but by communities from both sides of the border using tractors, diggers, drainage pipes and telephone poles.\n<br>\nLater that month the Irish Times reported that the bridge had become the site of a tense standoff between Irish Gardai and British army troops when they obstructed the army’s attempt to blow up the bridge.\n<br>\nThe bridge which had been blown up the week previous.  was being set with explosives by 50 men from the Royal Engineer when four Gardai came on the scene. They protested that the British officers were placing explosives on the Republic’s side of the bridge, parking their  patrol car mid-way across the bridge and radioing for back-up. 30 Irish troops  arrived and took up shooting positions as officers debated which parts of the bridge were in Northern Ireland and which in the South. 50 local people gathered to observe the two hour stand-off. Eventually, the Monaghan County Council engineer was called in who determined that British explosives charges obtruded nine feet into the Republic. The British officers admitted their mistake and Gardai took two boxes of 30 lb of explosives and electrical writing and detonators into their possess as a result to ‘trespassing’.\n<br>\nIn February 1972 the body of a man was found 200 yards from this bridge. He had been hooded, with his mouth taped and shot in the head. The man was a member of the Royal Ordinance Corps stationed at Kinnegar in Co. Down. He had gone missing after visiting his mother in Dublin and his body was discovered at 8am the next day by a local man on his way to Mass. It was believed he had been killed elsewhere.",

    "history":"\nThis was one of the few concession roads operating during The Troubles. This crossing had operated as a customs post in the 1950’s and had been bombed in 1956 (recorded as the third time on that occasion).<br> In May 1971 two British customs officers were injured when they tried to search a car crossing the border.\nThe driver who resented being searched jumped out of the car to confront officers while the front seat passenger jumped int the drivers seat and began to drive away. According the the Strabane Chronicle a customs officers suffered a broken wrist and bruises to his hips as he tried to prevent them by grabbing the car keys. Another officer was thrown on to the bonnet and then the ground when he tried to stop the car, injuring his back. As the two lay inured the two men in the car drove off.\n<br>\nIn January 1972, civilians clashed with troops as they tried to fill in two craters at this crossing. 50 British troops reportedly fired rubber bullets and gas canisters at the crowd, however winds carried the noxious gas back toward the soldiers who The Anglo Celt reported ‘had to run for shelter to the accompaniment of derisive cheers from the crowd’. Locals continued with heir work, felling small trees to fill in the craters. The soldiers returned launching gas canisters again at the crowd at a different angle. “Gardai and civilians were seen emerging from the blue cloud of gas choking and coughing and holding handkerchiefs tot her burning eyes. Several people overcome with nausea fell on the side of the road.” Again the locals, once recovered, returned to work and clashes broke out as troops approached with batons. Rubber bullets were shot at the crowd who threw stones in return. One civilian was shot with a rubber bullet and one soldier was struck in the knee with a rock. Civilians armed themselves with branches and continued to work - this back and forth continued during the afternoon until the craters were successfully filled in.\n<br>\nIn February 1972, ten people were injured after an arson attack on a customs post resulted in an explosion. The explosion occurred after a group of 600 people who were moving from crossing to crossing refilling in cratered roads gathered to remove ramps at the Clontivern stop. One individual approached the customs caravan at the site, setting it alight, however a man then threw a container of petrol into the fire and the caravan soon became a ‘raging inferno’, as reported by The Anglo Celt. As hundreds of onlookers stood around the fire, the flames reached a domestic gas container attacked to a heater in the caravan and there was a ‘terrific explosion and blazing debris and burning liquid enveloped the crowd.’\n<br>\nIt was reported that people were ‘blown off their feet’ by the force of the explosion and many people’s clothing was set alight. Ten people were removed to hospital suffering from burns and shock.\n<br> As well as the explosion, there was a considerable amount of chaos. The cars of two customs officers were attempted to be set alight. Later a rumour that the two customs officers who were missing had been kidnapped were discounted. After the explosion there was a slight collision between two cars opposite the customs post. A British army helicopter arrived to and began to sprinkle dye on the crowd from the air. The helicopter later searched the area into the night with large searchlights, sometimes crossing the boundary into the South. It was thought they were searching for the missing customs officers.\n<br>\nLater that month, a notice in the Anglo Celt read ‘owing to the repeated bombing and burning to the British customs frontier post at Clontivern, the customs authorities have moved the customs caravan a mile further back from the border. The post is now situated at the roadside at Clonmaulin and the officials are operating from a caravan which is towed away at night.\n<br>\nHowever, a story in The Anglo Celt a few days later read ‘customs post burned - again!’. The customs post was again the subject of an arson attack despite its new location.\n<br>\nIn April 1972, a British customs post caravan was burnt out after petrol was thrown upon it and it was set alight. This was the third arson attack on this customs at that point. \n<br> A few days later, a mile from the border, a mine believed to have been intended for British army vehicles was planted on the road. It was discovered and safely detonated by the British army. The resulting explosion knocked telephone polls which cut off the telephone lines between Clones and Enniskillen and  reportedly shook buildings in nearby town of Clones.\n<br>\nOne month later, in May, a British armoured patrol was fired upon from shrubbery on a hill 100 yards from the border. They returned fire, reportedly hitting one of the men on the hill. Local people reported there were 23-30 rounds of fire lasting 7 or 8 minutes. A number of civilians in the vicinity ran for shelter.\n<br>\nIn August 1981, the windows of the Irish Customs post on the south of the border crossing were broken by two youths. The 18 year old men from Northern Ireland were later charged in Court and apologised and said they had been drinking.\n<br>\nIn April 1993, locals on the South of the border complained of an incursion of a British army helicopter across the border, demanding action from Dublin.\n",

    "history":"Two soldiers were killed at the Annaghmarting security post in 1989 during an IRA ambush. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher visited the post a year later and the crossing was twice the target of an attempted ‘proxy bombing’.\n\nIn November 1990, a 28 year old man was forced by the IRA to be a ‘proxy bomber’ and drive  a 3,700 pound bomb, the biggest used in the North at that time, toward the Annaghmartin checkpoint. \n\n<br>The man had been abducted the evening before with his wife, tied to a post in a field and had his legs beaten supposedly to make it difficult for him to run when he reached his destination. When the man drove to the checkpoint, he disbanded the truck, shouted a warning and although the detonator exploded, the bomb did not go off. The Irish Times reported that it was believed this man was targeted as his wife worked in the police station and the shop they owned served security forces, making them ‘legitimate targets’. Their shop had been bombed twice previously and following the abduction, they went into hiding in a ‘safe house’.\n<br>\nIn September 1991 the Irish Times reported a similar incident happened when the IRA attempted to force a 23 year old man to act as a ‘human bomb’ in an attempt to blow up a British army checkpoint at Annaghmartin. The father of the man claimed his five children ranging in ages from six to their early 20’s were held hostage by the IRA because they were protestant. His son and 18 year old daughter were then forcibly taken to a field where IRA members were filling the trailer of a tractor with explosives packed inside oil barrels and plastic bags., with the intention of having the young man drive it into the checkpoint. However, the plan was abandoned when the tractor got stuck in the field and toppled onto its side.  The 300lb of explosives were later safely defused by the British army.\n\n\n",

    "history":"This crossing was one of the few concession roads operating during The Troubles where it was cratered and a military checkpoint was put in in place.\n<br>\nIn June 1971, the Strabane Weekly News reported that five soldiers had escaped a booby trap explosion nearby after a bomb was detonated from stolen mini which had been packed with explosives. The bomb was targeted at a passing British army patrol from a hideaway in a hedge. No one was injured but a six foot crater was created in the road.\n<br>\nIn October 1971, the army cratered the border road, causing considerable damage to a nearby house. The claim for damages was later taken to the High Court in Dublin.\n<br>\nIn January 1982, a local farmer complained that his cow had been shot with a bullet 30 yards from the checkpoint after a soldier responded to movement in the bushes with gunfire. The animal was later put down.\n<br>\nIn October 1982, a group of men attempted to bomb the crossing, laying 500lb of explosives in beer stacks near the crossing and operating it from nearby on a hill. When the bomb was detected the men were quickly surrounded by British army on the north side and Irish Gardai on the South. The Garda surrounded the men, firing a number of shots in the air and taking two men into custody. Eventually the bomb was rendered safe and removed.",

He had been blindfolded and shot through the head, with a sign stating ‘tout’ tied around his neck. Police suspected he had been executed by the IRA as they believed he was an ‘informer’.\n<br> There were many attempts to fill in the road by locals, including one occasion hen old cars were flipped into the crater in order to fill it and make it passable again.The Northern Standard reported on the scene on one occasion when it had become the focus of the ‘Border Buster Campaign’ to reopen closed crossings. After a successful six hour operation, ‘a small group from the Basque Country waved an Irish tri-colour, high-helped women from South Armagh and Dublin looked on in amazement, children played in the rush strewn field, a British Army helicopter hovered overhead,… the atmosphere was warm. Would this be the last time local farmers and their neighbours would have to open this road?’",

One was a lorry filled with fish and the other, an Ulsterbus, which had been hi-jacked by armed men and left  abandoned at the border for days. This not only lead to a traffic impediment but also a stench of rotten fish that affected locals living in the area. <br> In August 1972, The Irish Times reported that Garda investigative a shooting incident at Moybridge were fired on accidentally by a UDR patrol. It was said the patrol ‘was probably firing at some movements they noticed on this side of the Border, thinking their attackers had returned”. \n <br>\nIn May 1973 three armed men broke into the customs post caravan at the crossing and set it on fire. In March, gunmen who had attacked Emyvale village, crossed the border back into Northern Ireland over Moybridge afterwards, throwing petrol bombs at the pub a few yards south of the border. In October of that year, soldiers manning the checkpoint came under fire however no injuries were recorded. \n<br>\nIn 1988 a 24 year old man was shot dead walking past the permanent British army vehicle check at Aughnacloy.\n<br>\nIN a 1993 scoping Inquiry, the British army reported the crossing was attacked twice in 1989.\n<br>\nIn 1993, 4-500 people gathered on New Years Day to protest march through the checkpoint. They were protesting against the closure of the Irish border in contrast to all other EEC borders being abolished.\n<br>\nIn 1994, the British IRA targeted the army checkpoint with a rocket attack which was fired from the rear of a stolen tractor on the northern side. It missed its target however and failed to explode. The attack happened less than 72 hours after the end of the IRA’s ceasefire.\n<br>\n",

    "history":"This crossing was one of the few concession roads open during the Troubles with a customs post and military checkpoint along this road.\n\n<br>\nIn September 1971 two gun men ordered staff to leave Middletown customs post and threw a small bomb inside the damaging it. Immediately afterwards, an army patrol nearby became engaged in a gun battle when two mines exploded but missed their vehicles. \nAutomatic fire then opened resulting in a 30 minute gun battle. Some gunmen waded into the River Blackwater and escaped over the border.\n<br>\nIn February 1972, the Middletown customs post was attached by a number of petrol bombers, causing slight damage to the building.\n<br>\nIn March 1972 a 44 year old man was shot dead as he made a cup of tea in a hut outside Middletown customs post. Gunmen held up staff at the customs post while they shot the man who was a Lance Corporal in the Ulster Defence Regiment  12 times.\n<br>\nThe customs stop closed for the last time on New Years Eve in 1992.",

The man had been kidnapped previously and shot in the head. His remains were left 25 yards inside the Northern border. Those responsible for his killing then placed 600 pounds of explosives in the area around his body in an attempt to lure security forces into a booby trap on his discovery. It was described in the local paper, the Newry Reporter, as a ‘horror killing’.\n<br>\n A security barrier was placed across the road  in 1975 but was removed by locals in 1979. When British troops and RUC men returned to restore the barrier, a group of local farmers drove lorries and tractors onto the bridge in a bid to prevent it. They were however towed away and construction was completed.",

    "history":"This road was unapproved during the Troubles.<br>\nIn February 1972, soldiers narrowly avoided a booby trap in which a small ‘decoy; bomb was placed in a lorry for soldiers to investigate. The suspected plan was for paramilitaries to open fire on the soldiers, forcing them to seek shelter in a nearby old school where a 300lb bomb was laid ready to detonate. The soldiers however uncovered the wires leading to the bombs that stretched across the river into a barn on the Republic’s side. The bombs were safely detonated.\n<br>\nIn August 1975, The Irish Times reported that a 28 year old man went missing and his van was found burnt out at this crossing. His body was later discovered  in Newtownhamilton. He had been shot 12 times and was found badly beaten with his hands tied behind his back. He was an RUC reservist who lived in Newtownhamilton.\n",

One vehicle was set alight and the four soldiers drove back over the border in the other one, damaging the wheels in the process.

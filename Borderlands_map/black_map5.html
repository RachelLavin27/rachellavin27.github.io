In late August the customs caravan was bombed with two 10lb explosives. Two weeks later, custom officials were held at gunpoint and the temporary customs caravan was bombed again. At a later date about half a dozen men ordered customs officials from their caravan, planting a bomb inside, exploding and destroying the caravan. Two bombs were also planted at a filling station nearby causing a large blaze and injuring three people when flying shrapnel hit a passing car. <br><br>On the evening of the 3rd of October 1972 the army reported that an army mobile patrol was heavily stoned in Creggan and soldiers had fired rubber bullets to disperse the crowd. Later that night machine gun fire was targeted at the border between Muff and Culmore at 1am and 5am that night.<br><br>The following month in November 1972 the Culmore checkpoint was targeted again when a 10lb bomb was left inside a duffle bag near an electricity transformer at Healthfield, Culmore Road. An army patrol found the explosives, and they were removed and detonated safely nearby.<br><br>Later that month again, on the 28th of November, there were two gun attacks on british army units, coordinated in close timing with each other at border crossing points. At 10.50am army units came under fire after going to investigate a ‘mystery explosion’ in a hut near the post. 20 shots were fired at the army who returned fire. <br><br>Five minutes later near Buncrana, a hi-jacked lorry was driven over the border and set alight. When army units attended the scene, along with police and Fire services, gunmen opened fire from three points starting a gun battle that continued for over an hour, utilising two rocket launchers, automatic weapons and almost 700 rounds. There were no reported casualties.<br><br>On February 21st, 1976, two milk-churns containing 150lbs of home made explosives that were believed to be destined for Northern Ireland were abandoned about 20 feet from the Derry/Londonderry-Donegal border and had to be safely detonated.<br><br>Two months later troops opened fire on two men carrying rocket launchers near the checkpoint. There were no casualties.<br><br>In April 1979, a customs officer was shot in the knee, after he stopped a car he suspected of smuggling between Northern Ireland and southern Ireland. This resulted in the loss of his leg.<br><br>On the 23rd of July, 1993, a 100 lb bomb exploded after being placed at the fence at the Culmore check-point. The bomb was intended to attack the newly enlarged checkpoint which local people had accused the British Army of purposefully expanding to be near the homes of local people so it could use them as ‘human shields’ in order to ward off IRA attacks.",

No one was injured.<br><br>Three days later, the Coshquinn customs post was bombed again overnight. The explosion practically demolished the inside of the building, blowing out the rear windows.<br><br>On a Monday afternoon in November 1972 shots were fired at soldiers 500 yards from the border and again an hour later at Strabane Old Road.<br><br> Later that month, the UDA planted a bomb near this crossing that exploded outside a garage. A man and three children were injured by flying glass. A spokesman for the UDA claimed the bomb was in retaliation to the IRA storing explosives in housing estates in Buncrana.<br><br> In October, a cylinder containing wires and explosives were found near the customs post.<br><br>In October 1990, the Coshquinn Checkpoint was bombed by the IRA, killing five members of the British army and one civilian. It was one of the deadliest attacks on a customs post during the Troubles.<br><br>In September, 1994 100 people removed border barriers overnight at three locations as part of the Border Buster Campaign.<br><br>Four days later, a bomb was planted 800 metres from the Coshquinn checkpoint. The bomb was discovered by children playing in a field and safely detonated by the British army. Sinn Fein blamed loyalist individuals targeting their border removal campaign.<br><br>The day before Christmas Eve in 1995, a bomb planted on the Buncrana road, believed to have been targeted at a passing army patrol, ended up narrowly missing a family of two parents and three children on their way to a Christmas party. This came one week after the signing of the Downing Street Declaration.",

																		"history": "The crossing sat in the middle of the bridge between two towns - Lifford and Strabane - and was the site of numerous acts of violence, both between residents in both towns and paramilitaries and the British army. Despite numerous attempts to place barriers and obstacles, including an infamous 'camel's hump' ramp, the checkpoint was repeatedly bombed and burnt down. Three people were killed at this crossing.<br><br>One of the first reported incidents was on a Tuesday morning in January 1971, when the Lifford road station and frontier post were heavily bombed. Residents in the local area described it as ‘the loudest they had ever heard’ with the Donegal Democrat reporting that “not a plate glass window is intact in the town as a result’.<br><br>In March, a newly installed security barrier was bombed. The barrier was erected to seal the border to traffic in an emergency as the bridge had become a ‘favourite escape route’ particularly after bank raids.<br><br>That April there was a bomb hoax at the crossing.<br><br>In September of that year the replacement customs hut was wrecked after a number of masked men held customs men at gunpoint, planting two gelignite bombs inside which exploded, wrecking the hut and and slightly injuring two passers-by.In the aftermath of the bomb, a crowd gathered, stoning the military patrol when it arrived and smashing windows in Strabane. <br><br>In November, a young woman was killed after becoming caught up in gunfire at the crossing. She had been walking across the bridge as the British army were building a ramp at the border to slow traffic. As a result, a large number of troops were present. Shots reportedly came from across the border targeting the army and when shooting ceased soldiers on the bridge observed that the girl, who had been walking behind them on the bridge, 'sank to the ground'. She was rushed to Strabana hospital in an army landrover where she died a few days later from 'severe head injuries'. The young woman had been a waitress at a hotel in Lifford and was returning across the bridge to her home in Strabane.<br>That evening a group or about 50 youths threw stones at troops and attempted to remove the ramp with pick-axes but were repelled by British troops with rubber bullets and gas canisters. A bus was hijacked on the Northern side and set alight.<br><br>A young man also died at this crossing after being struck by a rubber bullet during clashes at the army checkpoint. He was reported to have died due to asphyxia brought on by the injuries received as a result of being shot at a close distance.<br><br>In February 1972 the customs post was completely demolished in an explosion carried out by three masked gunmen. <br>That same month a van carrying English Sunday newspapers was hi-jacked by three men, the newspapers burnt and thrown in the river. <br><br>Between June 1971 and March 1972 further barriers to the ramp were set up, including a steel barrier the Strabane Chronicle claimed was erected in secret and concrete blocks and permanent ‘pill blocks’ facing traffic to make an S-turn at minimal speed. “Since the new barricade has been erected earlier this week there have been two shooting incidents across the border”, the Chronicle reported.<br><br>In December 1972 a crowd of 50 people crossed the border from Strabane and according to the Ulster Herald, threw petrol bombs at the Lifford Customs post - starting a fire in the wooden building.<br><br>In November 1973, loyalist extremists placed a car-bomb on the bridge which exploded, causing structural damage to the bridge.<br><br>At one point a 'booby-trapped' army torch was also planted at the checkpoint by the Strabane provisional IRA - the torch was rigged to detonate on being switched on however it did not succeed in exploding.<br><br>On January 25 1975, Lifford Customs post was bombed, damaging a nearby shop and filling station.<br><br>In April, 1980, a civilian travelling across the bridge by car was shot dead after a British soldier discharged his rifle as the car approached the crossing. The victim, a 53 year old nurse in Strabane hospital, was returning home with her husband and relatives after celebrating her silver wedding anniversary. She was killed instantly. Her husband reported he had been driving very slowly about 150 yards from the checkpoint over ramps when ‘suddenly the windscreen shattered with a loud bang…I looked around to see if everything was alright in the back. Then I saw my wife. She as lying there, struck down dead.” The soldier, a 19 year old, was later charged for the unlawful killing.<br> <br>In July 1985, a bomb attack planted by the Provisional IRA injured three policemen and seven civilians on the Strabane-Lifford border. A half ton of explosives was detonated 50 yards from the bridge’s ‘camel’s hump’ ramp as an RUC Landrover passed the checkpoint. Shops and businesses were damaged by the blast and staff and patients in Lifford Hospital were showered with glass when the windows were blown in. <br><br>These are just a sample of incidents that occurred at the Lifford bridge crossing and its surrounding areas.",

Donegal at this point.<br><br>A year later, in October 1971, approximately 100 British soldiers were cratering local road crossings when they reportedly came under attack with automatic gunfire. The British army returned fire. Local people reported to the Strabane Weekly News that two soldiers were wounded and taken away. The army reported that one gunman was hit. Once the army withdrew the Donegal Democrat reported that “Immediately the local people on both sides of the Border commandeered a bulldozer from a nearby building site and filled in the craters”. A ceremonial tape was cut by Senator Bernard McGlinchey and an Irish flag was hoisted.<br><br>Later that evening a bus was hi-jacked by two masked gunmen who set it ablaze at the site of the cratering.<br><br>In February 1972, an Ulsterbus was again hijacked when the bus driver was held at gunpoint and instructed to drive to the border where the bus was set alight. The bus was to take shift workers to Herdman’s mill at Sion mill. The Provisional IRA denied involvement.<br><br>In March 1994, the crossing was the site of a failed mortar attack after the British army found. 25 families from the surrounding area had to be evacuated as the bomb, which was packed with between 200 and 300 pounds of home-made explosives - was safely detonated.",

Two armed men had ordered British customs officials out of the building, laying two sacks of explosives which they detonated, completely destroying the post. A house and shop nearby were damaged by the blast. A few weeks later a building 100 yards away from the border post would also blasted with a bomb.<br><br>By November, the Donegal democrat reported that “customs staff at Belleek, Co. Fermanagh are having a particularly trying and confusing time as their frontier post has been bombed out twice and burned three times.” A caravan replacement for the border post was blown up, then a second, third and fourth replacement caravan were burnt out. Five further customs caravan were reported to have been burnt the following month of December in quick succession.	<br>Later that month, the Donegal Democrat reported that ‘the twelfth caravan serving as temporary accommodation for British Custom men at the Belleek frontier went up in flames on Saturday morning last.” Customs officials had taken to transporting the customs van out of the area each evening however on Saturday morning the transfer was interrupted by a group of armed men who placed the caravana and car towing it across the road and lighting both on fire.<br><br> Shots were also fired at a British army patrol during this period but, although road blocks were set up at the border crossing, no one was apprehended.<br><br> During this period, the Donegal Democrat reported that the area of Belleek became heavily militarised. “The British army moved in in force and have been active in the area from Belleek through Garrison to the Border at Kiltyclogher. They operate heavily camouflaged through fields and laneways striking terror into families in rural areas. Several times they have made incursions into the territory of the Republic and one one occasion - at Belleek, they penetrated so far that Gardai observers found it necessary to call out the army from Finner Camp.” <br><br>The paper claimed locals became resentful after reports of British troops visiting houses in the Belleek area and questioning the residents on their religion. “If Catholics live in the house, it is officially noted…On visitations to non-Catholic houses, the troops have asked if they are being molested in any way by any of their Catholic neighbours.” The paper reported community relations between Catholics and Protestants were at a high level and the army’s actions were ‘as bitterly resented by Protestants as Catholics’.“Many people believe it is an attempt to foment sectarian strife between people who have always respected each other’s religious views and political opinions.”<br><br>The following year, in April 1972 the customs caravan was set alight yet again<br><br> In August 1972, a British military escort helping men transport wages to Belleek Pottery were fired upon from across the border. It lasted for about 20 minutes, forcing men, women and children to dive for shelter. Travelers passing through the post abandoned their cars to lie on the roadside and behind ditches. Several cars were hit with bullets.	<br>	In September 1973 the customs post was sealed off twice in one day due to reports a bomb had been placed nearby.<br>In January 1977 a bomb exploded 100 yards from the customs post.

It was met with eager anticipation by the local Cashel Community group who claimed the bridge closure leads to diversions which had separated the border community for 25 years. <br>On its reopening they commented in the Fermanagh Herald “There is so much work to be done because the young people of the area don’t even know their neighbours who live a mile down the road and the older generation will want to renew old acquaintances with whom they lost contact.” <br>The Leitrim Observer declared in a headline “Kiltyclogher no longer a ‘cul-de-sac” while the Fermanagh Herald's healine read 'Re-opening of Cashel Bridge will help reunite old friends'.", "today": "Today, traffic can flow freely across this bridge",

A Sunday Independent article in 1970 reported on what this meant for the local area. It referred to the area as ‘a geographical cultural de sac’ causing ‘situations which would be amusing if they were not infuriating’. Anyone caught passing the unapproved road faced hefty fines, yet the northern customs post closed at 5pm and the southern at 8pm. Churchgoers crossing the border were given a concession pass during stated hours and clergymen could use the road while ‘on their lawful business’ but not carry goods or passengers. A funeral carrying a deceased person could cross the border but the profession of cars would have to take a detour. The article was titled 'It’s not funny - Say border men' in which they called for the opening up of the roads.<br><br>b In October 1971 the British army placed 8 ramps on the border road, six of which were removed by local people. Two more would be removed with sledge hammers, pick axes and crowbars the following March. <br><br>In February 1972, the Anglo Celt reported the incursion of two British armoured cars into the South.<br> <br> The border was closed for a time in 1972 by a roadblock manned by British soldiers. The Anglo Celt reported it was a cause of 'severe hardship' to locals, claiming 'not since partition was imposed on this country in 1920 have cross-border conditions been so bad'.<br><br> A gun battle erupted between the British military who were maintaining a road block and armed men in November of that year.The following month, a rocket attack was launched at the checkpoint at 4.35pm on a Monday.

It was reported that a bomb which killed two people in Belturbet in a stolen car was believed to have been taken across it.<br>In January 1973, the repaired bridge was wrecked in an explosion at 12.40 in the mornning and a second explosion destroyed the Irish customs hut. A family with two children living on the northern side of the border had been given a one minute warning to take shleter by a man tapping on their bedroom window. They quickly placed their children in prams and walked up the road to escape the blast. No one was injured. <br><br>Aghalane bridge was never reopened - today the begginings of the bridge is still apparent on both sides of the river but is railed off. )However, over twenty years later in February 1999 at a cost of £6.5 million a nearby replacement bridge was named The Senator George Mitchell Peace Bridge after the US Senator who helped accomplish the Good Friday Agreement and laid the first beam of the bridge.", "today": "Today, traffic flows freely across the stone bridge and a memorial marks its history as 'The Senator George Mitchell Peace Bridge'.",

It claimed the road had been blasted six times and filled in again by locals, using even an abandoned hijacked Ulsterbus to fill the crater. The road closures, it said, had ’virtually cut off (Drumilly) from the rest of Co. Monaghan.’ <br> In June 1992, The Northern Standard described a tense confrontation near this border road when nine British soldiers who had crossed into the Republic were challenged by local people working on the bog. The paper reported that following a heated confrontation between the two parties that lasted 15 minutes the soldiers took up a firing position, which included pointing a gun at a twelve year old girl. It goes on “Everybody, including about thirty people working in the Derrybeg bog about a quarter of a mile from the Border, armed themselves with turf.” The standoff ended after an hour when the soldiers decided to leave the area.", "today": "Today, there is little indication this quiet country road is a border crossing.",

The bridge which had been blown up the week previous and was being set with explosives by 50 men from the Royal Engineer when four Gardai came on the scene. They protested that the British officers were placing explosives on the Republic’s side of the bridge, parking their patrol car mid-way across the bridge and radioing for back-up. 30 Irish troops arrived and took up shooting positions as officers debated which parts of the bridge were in Northern Ireland and which in the South. <br>50 local people gathered to observe the two hour stand-off. Eventually, the Monaghan County Council engineer was called in who determined that British explosives charges obtruded nine feet into the Republic. The British officers admitted their mistake and Gardai took two boxes of 30 lb of explosives and electrical writing and detonators into their possession as a result to ‘trespassing’.<br><br>In February 1972 the body of a man was found 200 yards from this bridge. He had been hooded, with his mouth taped and shot in the head. The man was a member of the Royal Ordinance Corps stationed at Kinnegar in Co. Down. He had gone missing after visiting his mother in Dublin and his body was discovered at 8am the next day by a local man on his way to Mass.

This crossing had operated as a customs post in the 1950’s and had been bombed in 1956 (recorded as the third time on that occasion).<br> <br>In May 1971 two British customs officers were injured when they tried to search a car crossing the border. The driver who resented being searched jumped out of the car to confront officers while the front seat passenger jumped int the drivers seat and began to drive away. According the the Strabane Chronicle a customs officers suffered a broken wrist and bruises to his hips as he tried to prevent them by grabbing the car keys. Another officer was thrown on to the bonnet and then the ground when he tried to stop the car, injuring his back. As the two lay inured the two men in the car drove off.<br><br>In January 1972, civilians clashed with troops as they tried to fill in two craters at this crossing. 50 British troops reportedly fired rubber bullets and gas canisters at the crowd, however winds carried the noxious gas back toward the soldiers who The Anglo Celt reported ‘had to run for shelter to the accompaniment of derisive cheers from the crowd’. Locals continued with heir work, felling small trees to fill in the craters. The soldiers returned launching gas canisters again at the crowd at a different angle. “Gardai and civilians were seen emerging from the blue cloud of gas choking and coughing and holding handkerchiefs tot her burning eyes. Several people overcome with nausea fell on the side of the road.” Again the locals, once recovered, returned to work and clashes broke out as troops approached with batons. Rubber bullets were shot at the crowd who threw stones in return. One civilian was shot with a rubber bullet and one soldier was struck in the knee with a rock. Civilians armed themselves with branches and continued to work - this back and forth continued during the afternoon until the craters were successfully filled in.<br><br>In February 1972, ten people were injured after an arson attack on a customs post resulted in an explosion. The explosion occurred after a group of 600 people who were moving from crossing to crossing refilling in cratered roads gathered to remove ramps at the Clontivern stop. One individual approached the customs caravan at the site, setting it alight, however a man then threw a container of petrol into the fire and the caravan soon became a ‘raging inferno’, as reported by The Anglo Celt. As hundreds of onlookers stood around the fire, the flames reached a domestic gas container attacked to a heater in the caravan and there was a ‘terrific explosion and blazing debris and burning liquid enveloped the crowd.’<br><br>It was reported that people were ‘blown off their feet’ by the force of the explosion and many people’s clothing was set alight. Ten people were removed to hospital suffering from burns and shock.<br> <br>As well as the explosion, there was a considerable amount of chaos. The cars of two customs officers were attempted to be set alight. Later a rumour that the two customs officers who were missing had been kidnapped were discounted. After the explosion there was a slight collision between two cars opposite the customs post. A British army helicopter arrived to and began to sprinkle dye on the crowd from the air. The helicopter later searched the area into the night with large searchlights, sometimes crossing the boundary into the South. It was thought they were searching for the missing customs officers.<br><br>Later that month, a notice in the Anglo Celt read ‘owing to the repeated bombing and burning to the British customs frontier post at Clontivern, the customs authorities have moved the customs caravan a mile further back from the border. The post is now situated at the roadside at Clonmaulin and the officials are operating from a caravan which is towed away at night.<br><br>However, a story in The Anglo Celt a few days later read ‘customs post burned - again!’. The customs post was again the subject of an arson attack despite its new location.<br><br>In April 1972, a British customs post caravan was burnt out after petrol was thrown upon it and it was set alight. This was the third arson attack on this customs at that point. <br><br> A few days later, a mile from the border, a mine believed to have been intended for British army vehicles was planted on the road. It was discovered and safely detonated by the British army. The resulting explosion knocked telephone polls which cut off the telephone lines between Clones and Enniskillen and  reportedly shook buildings in nearby town of Clones.<br><br>One month later, in May, a British armoured patrol was fired upon from shrubbery on a hill 100 yards from the border. They returned fire, reportedly hitting one of the men on the hill. Local people reported there were 23-30 rounds of fire lasting 7 or 8 minutes. A number of civilians in the vicinity ran for shelter.<br><br>In August 1981, the windows of the Irish Customs post on the south of the border crossing were broken by two youths. The 18 year old men from Northern Ireland were later charged in Court and apologised and said they had been drinking.<br><br>In April 1993, locals on the South of the border complained of an incursion of a British army helicopter across the border, demanding action from Dublin.", "today": "Today, traffic flows freely along this border crossing.",

Locals continued with heir work, felling small trees to fill in the craters. The soldiers returned launching gas canisters again at the crowd at a different angle. “Gardai and civilians were seen emerging from the blue cloud of gas choking and coughing and holding handkerchiefs to their burning eyes. Several people overcome with nausea fell on the side of the road.” Again the locals, once recovered, returned to work and clashes broke out as troops approached with batons. Rubber bullets were shot at the crowd who threw stones in return. One civilian was shot with a rubber bullet and one soldier was struck in the knee with a rock. Civilians armed themselves with branches and continued to work - this back and forth continued during the afternoon until the craters were successfully filled in.<br><br>In February, about 200 people, mostly from the Republic, gathered to fill in road craters after the road had been cratered for the fifth time. They felled trees on approach roads to prevent a surprise attack by the British army however there was no interference by the troops. A path was cut into a field to form an alternative root and two Irish flags were raised.<br><br>On a separate occasion that month, locals attempted to refill this cratered road when the British army arrived to intervene. 30 soldiers were seen deployed around hedges on the Northern side and began to launch gas canisters at the crowd. 50 locals fought back, throwing stones and missiles at British vehicles. The vehicles withdrew but troops continued to shoot CS gas, marker dye and rubber bullets lasting about an hour until darkness approached. The Ulster Herald reported that ‘the rubber bullet marksmanship’ was poor and no one was injured.<br><br>Again in March, 800 people gathered to fill in the a series of craters that had been blown in this road, including bus loads from Dublin with some bringing their own spades and shovels to assist in the filling in. The British army intervened, leading to a three hour stone throwing battle where troops fired about 60 rounds of rubber bullets and 30 gas canisters. The Anglo Celt reported an unusual scene where while youths threw stones and collected rubber bullets to sell as souvenirs to the Dubliners at 50p each, a British helicopter flew low to drop red dye on the protestors and one man, on a bet, walked up to the armed soldiers and was beaten and arrested as a result, the work of filling in the craters was left to the ladies. Women formed a human chain to carry stones and ‘In the long female line nun was to be seen alongside mink-coated ladies from Dublin keeping the supply of stones moving.’A number of people were reported to be injured by rubber bullets and a few were affected by the gas.<br><br>That same month, when troops came to bomb the road again, locals gathered to make a ‘strong protest’ and the explosives were removed.<br><br>In April, two young men were arrested after attempting to remove car tyres from a silo pit on the Monaghan side of the border and fighting with Gardai to intervened. A sergeant suffered superficial facial injuries as a result.Their arrests resulted in 100 protestors gathering outside the Garda Barracks in Clones, who were roughly dispersed by hand by police. After an hour the two men were released. Later that night up to 300 people gathered again and broke in the door of the local Sinn Fein Council member. They were dispersed with a baton charge.<br><br> In June, a hoax bomb was placed in the middle of the road at this crossing. It comprised of. Large biscuit tin with wires extending into the hedge. Local famed playwright Eugene McCabe discovered the hoax as he brought his children to school and alerted Gardai. A local farmer attempting to detonate it discovered it was a hoax.<br><br>In August, The Ulster Herald reported that two British ferret cars had a narrow escape when a landmine exploded as they passed the cratered crossing. The blast sent ‘a shower of boulders’ hurtling 50 feet into the air. A number of civilians also had a narrow escape.<br><br>This was one of the first few border roads to be officially reopened in the Autumn of 1994.", "today": "Today, there is little to indicate this scenic country bridge is a border crossing.",

British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher visited the post a year later and the crossing was twice the target of an attempted ‘proxy bombing’.<br><br>In November 1990, a 28 year old man was forced by the IRA to be a ‘proxy bomber’ and drive a 3,700 pound bomb, the biggest used in the North at that time, toward the Annaghmartin checkpoint.<br>The man had been abducted the evening before with his wife, tied to a post in a field and had his legs beaten supposedly to make it difficult for him to run when he reached his destination. When the man drove to the checkpoint, he disbanded the truck, shouted a warning and although the detonator exploded, the bomb did not go off. The Irish Times reported that it was believed this man was targeted as his wife worked in the police station and the shop they owned served security forces, making them ‘legitimate targets’. Their shop had been bombed twice previously and following the abduction, they went into hiding in a ‘safe house’.<br><br>In September 1991 the Irish Times reported a similar incident happened when the IRA attempted to force a 23 year old man to act as a ‘human bomb’ in an attempt to blow up a British army checkpoint at Annaghmartin. The father of the man claimed his five children ranging in ages from six to their early 20’s were held hostage by the IRA because they were protestant. His son and 18 year old daughter were then forcibly taken to a field where IRA members were filling the trailer of a tractor with explosives packed inside oil barrels and plastic bags. The intention appeared to be to have the young man drive it into the checkpoint and the bomb explode. However, the plan was abandoned when the tractor got stuck in the field and toppled onto its side. The 300lb of explosives were later safely defused by the British army.", "today": "Today, the only indication this road is a border crossing is two border road signs on either side of the road.",

In October of that year, soldiers manning the checkpoint came under fire however no injuries were recorded.<br>In 1988 a 24 year old man was shot dead walking past the permanent British army vehicle check at Aughnacloy.<br>IN a 1993 scoping Inquiry, the British army reported the crossing was attacked twice in 1989.<br>In 1993, 400-500 people gathered on New Years Day to protest march through the checkpoint.

They left their buses, stopped traffic, surrounded the customs station banging on their windows and chanted ‘We shall overcome’. They eventually returned to their buses and accepted the customs demands.<br><br>In February, 1971 armed men rushed staff from the customs post and bombed the building. They returned hours later to set the building on fire, gutting the building completely. Similar bombing attacks on the building were repeated in June, September and November.<br><br>In September, a speeding car refused to stop at the checkpoint and crashed into a British army landcover, injuring two soldiers.<br><br>In December two men were killed in a shooting at the crossing. The men, a customs official and cleaner working at the post, were caught in a hail of bullets directed at the army as they approached the border post, according to the Newry Reporter. The shooting came from four men on a hillside on the southern side of the border. Just a few hours earlier a temporary building at the post had been bombed. The customs officer, a local man had been making tea in the canteen when he reportedly fell to the floor. Another official dragged the man to the road where a motorist picked them up and bought them to the hospital. The man was pronounced dead on arrival. A customs officer remaining at the post sought to evacuate the staff and running to an outdoor hut, found the cleaner lying in a pool of blood. He was given first aid by soldiers but pronounced dead before reaching the hospital.<br><br> That same month outdoor pens were bombed and it was followed by shooting from the south at a British army helicopter and scout car.	<br><br> In February 1972, hijacked vehicles were blown up and set ablaze causing an obstruction at the crossing. A man and wife later crashed into one of the hijacked lorries, sustaining head injuries. This use of hi-jacked lorries to blockade the roads would be repeated again in June.<br><br>In March, a ‘monster bomb’ containing 300 pounds of gelignite exploded at Killeen wrecking a filling station and damaging the roof of a house.  A 12 feet wide crater was blown in the ground and the blast was reportedly heard 10 miles way however no one was injured.<br><br> In April, In April 1972, a man was abducted from the lorry he drove by four terrorists just as he entered the North at Killeen and his body found a few days later partially covered with a gunshot to his head. His remains were left 25 yards inside the Northern border at Altnamackin. Those responsible for his killing then placed 600 pounds of explosives in the area around his body in an attempt to lure security forces into a booby trap on his discovery. It was described in the local paper, the Newry Reporter, as a ‘horror killing’.<br><br>In August of that year, 8 people died in an explosion at the vehicle examination station at the post in what the Newly Reported called ‘Newry’s worst bombing outrage’. The bombing occurred when two men carried a box of explosives into the post which exploded prematurely, killing them and six civilians, including four customs officials and two lorry drivers. Six more were injured. The local reporter described a harrowing scene saying ‘it wasn’t just another bomb at a customs station. It was a dreadful nightmare of stark reality - a bomb of death.’ They described how ‘the bodies of the dead were severely mutilated and firemen and ambulance crew had the gruesome task of picking up limbs and broken skulls, collecting the remains in plastic bags’.<br><br>A week later, a customs post caravan would be destroyed in an arson attack overnight.<br><br>", "today": "Today, there is little to indicate this roads tragic past.",

They had been stripped naked, hooded, and shot in the head in a triple execution later claimed by the IRA. One man had a milk tray left on his body in order to attract attention to his remains. On their discovery the RUC cleared local areas in order to ensure the bodies had not been booby trapped before removing them. The IRA said they had killed three members of their organisation as they believed them to be undercover agents - one a British MI5 agent and two RUC ‘informers’ who they claimed were responsible for the murder of a 26 year old woman whose body had been found in a shallow grave in Sligo the previous day. She allegedly had been killed over fears she may expose the men and the three men had been killed in turn. The Irish Times reported on shocked response to the killings, all found within an hour of each other on a July night. UK Prime Minister condemned the killings in the House of Commons while one SDLP member described the killings as ‘an act of obscene horror’. <br><br> In January 1993 a number of shots were fired by soldiers at a vehicle as it drove through this checkpoint at 5.30am. The vehicle had failed to stop at an earlier checkpoint and was later found on fire nearby.

<p>From recession to recovery, have we moved from boom to bust to boom again in the 2010's?
	How has Ireland's wealth and debts changed? How did house prices and homelessness numbers develop? Did we do enough to prevent climate change?
	Are we a healthier people or a stronger democracy? Draw your guesses on the charts below to
see if your perception matches the facts.

							<br>
							<p>Irish people are wealthier than ever before, reaching a record high of €780.4 billion in cumulative household wealth by the end of the decade.

							Household net worth accounts for the assets minus the debts of each home. At the peak of the Celtic Tiger, household net worth was valued at €719 billion. This has been surpassed every quarter since the beginning of 2018.
							The latest figures have risen 1.6 per cent on the last quarter, driven primarily by developments in house prices, the accumulation of financial assets as well as the considerable deleveraging that followed the financial crisis.

							The average Irish household now has a net worth of €158,574.

							src="https://businesspost.github.io/you-draw-it-graph-unemployment_rate/index.html"></iframe>

							<br>
							<p>The 2010's saw a sustained period of severe unemployment. At its peak in 2012, one in six people between 15 and 74 were considered unemployed.
								However, by the end of the decade, unemployment figures have returned to a pre-crisis low, staying at 4.8 per cent for the last three months of 2019. These levels were last seen in February 2007, 13 years ago.
							</p>
							<br>
							<br>
							<iframe  data-preserve-html-node="true" id="map2" width="100%" height="720px"
							src="https://businesspost.github.io/you-draw-it-graph-emmigration/index.html"></iframe>

							<br>
							<p>With high levels of unemployment came a significant flow of emigration from Ireland.
								 This peaked in 2012 when 83,000 people were estimated to have emigrated.
								 Despite the economic recovery, levels of emigration have still not returned to pre-crisis levels.</p>
							<br>
							<br>
							<iframe  data-preserve-html-node="true" id="map2" width="100%" height="720px"
							src="https://businesspost.github.io/you-draw-it-graph-debt/index.html"></iframe>
							<p>By the end of the 2010's, Ireland's debt burden has grown to €206 billion.
								This is the third highest in the developed world when evaluated on a per capita basis,
								amounting to €42,000 for every person resident in the State. </p>
							<br>
							<br>
							<iframe  data-preserve-html-node="true" id="map2" width="100%" height="720px"
							src="https://businesspost.github.io/you-draw-it-graph-house_prices/index.html"></iframe>
							<p>House prices fell considerably during the 2010's. This followed a building boom where property was considerably
								 overvalued and oversupplied, quickly leading to a crash for the construction industry in the early 2010's.

								However, as the economy recovered and the population grew, the construction industry was slow to recover.
								The decade ended with the inverse problem - a severe undersupply of housing - resulting in a return to house prices not seen since 2005.  </p>
								<br>
								<br>
							<iframe  data-preserve-html-node="true" id="map2" width="100%" height="720px"
							src="https://businesspost.github.io/you-draw-it-graph-homeless/index.html"></iframe>
							<p>Ireland is one of three European countries which records data on homelessness on a monthly basis.
								Although this data is only available from mid-decade it captures the escalation of the numbers of people experiencing homelessness.
								The rate of homelessness encapsulates the housing crisis that defined
							the late 2010's. 2019 ended with a record 10,448 people in homelessness, 3,752 of whom were children.</p>
							<iframe  data-preserve-html-node="true" id="map2" width="100%" height="720px"
							src="https://businesspost.github.io/you-draw-it-graph-emmissions/index.html"></iframe>
							<br>
							<br><p>Despite this being the decade the Irish government realised its obligations under the Paris Agreement
								to reach carbon net-zero by mid-century, there has been minimal progress toward this goal. Carbon emmissions (both ETS and non-ETS)
								had briefly decreased during the economic recession, as the scale of industry production and consumption declined.
								However, as the economy recovered it increased again between 2014 and 2017 and was projected to have returned to similar levels at the end of the decade (61,532 kt in 2020) as at the beginning (61,104 kt in 2010).
							  </p>
							<iframe  data-preserve-html-node="true" id="map2" width="100%" height="720px"
							src="https://businesspost.github.io/you-draw-it-graph-renewable/index.html"></iframe>
							<p> At the start of the decade,
								renewable energy accounted for 7 per cent of electricty supply.
								By the end of the decade, one third of electricty produced was renewable with
							wind accounting for 28 percent, hydro for 2 per cent, biomass for 2 per cent and
							landfill gas, biogas and solar energy accounting for the remainder. The government has set a target of increasing to 70 per cent renewable energy in the electricity sector by 2030.</p>
							<iframe  data-preserve-html-node="true" id="map2" width="100%" height="720px"
							src="https://businesspost.github.io/you-draw-it-graph-government/index.html"></iframe>
							<p>
								The Corruption Perceptions Index ranks countries by their perceived levels of public sector corruption with countries that tend to do best linked
								 to having healthier democracies with strong democratic instutions and political rights.
								 Ireland ranks highly among western democracies, however the country suffered a significant fall in the rankings in 2012 during
								  the peak of the recession. While Ireland finished the decade ranked as 18th least corrupt country in the world,
									the score for clean governance remains lower than at the beginning of the decade.

							src="https://businesspost.github.io/you-draw-it-graph-health/index.html"></iframe>
							<p>Advancements in healthcare and living standards are expected to have increased the
							lifespan of Irish citizens born in the 2010's.
							Citizens born in Ireland in the middle of the 2015 will have gained four years of healthy life
							compared to those born a decade earlier in 2005.  </p>
